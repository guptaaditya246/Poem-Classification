The Ant thinks about her nieces and nephews,
As she watches out the second story window
Of her apartment, waiting for a parade;
While, an Assassin Bug below, waits in hiding
Near the phone booth; being
Worked on by the Telephone Bug.
The Ladybug and the Leafcutter talk,
With no thought of danger,
Beside the garden; as, the Army Ant 
Stands guard near the crowded street.
The Praying Mantis adjusts his cloth;
Before, walking into the church.
Meanwhile, the Crane Fly adjusts
His crane for another window, to wash;
And sees the Cockroach and the Bedbug
About to…well, we won’t talk about them!
A Deathwatch Beetle, on a building top,
Is intently watching the Assassin Bug
Below – just waiting for the right moment.
A formation of Wasps flies overhead;
As the Monarch and the Emperor Butterflies
Approach the crowd, awaiting their arrival
In the Parade of Colors Procession.
Water Beetle is pedaling bottled water
To the waiting masses, on the streets.
Suddenly, Robber Fly has darted out 
Of a store with his haul;
Knocking the Assassin Bug down and out!
Deathwatch and Firefly immediately
Shoots them both, dead, and saves
Another, “Day in the Life”, in Beetletown.
“I Want To Hold Your Hand”!!!

1,spt,Spring - A Poem for the Seasons,"Unveiled in the light of the rising dawn itself,
the beauty of a world once covered in White.
Awoken in a manner slower than anticipated,
unfolding itself across the plains and valleys.
Beautiful are the spectacles which rise again,
and set afire is the horizon in a glorious canvas
of red, orange, and yellow hues of unimaginable
vigor which hold a sense of light in every flower.

The sun climbs from the eastern wheat fields,
eventually towering over the highest mountain,
splitting the valleys with its radiating fashion,
impressing the trees as the wave their leaves",Nature

	within the woods I wandered

3,Dlmchale,Awakening Our Memories,"
We shall sail through the air a thousand country miles -
watch the falcons pirouette in the summer sky;
lunch upon bitter green apples and fermented mangoes
and nap beneath the cool luminous clouds;
quench our thirst with melodious wine
and toss stones down upon frozen lakes.
We shall immortalize poets against the echoing granite walls of time.
In bare feet we will land and dance in verdant green meadows
that carpet a bottomless valley; 
trace our fingertips along the gnarled grooves
of a dying oak and bid it farewell.
We will bathe in babbling brooks that giggle at 
our nakedness and dry ourselves in the wispy autumn winds.
Upon mountaintops, we shall squeeze sunsets between
our forefinger and thumb and slowly open them again to
the shimmering glow of a new moon.
We shall sleep beneath a canopy of universes and compose
our dreams against shimmering stars;
build wet sandcastles fit for kings on foreign shores
and feed them to the ravenous surf.
Beneath cascading waterfalls we'll write tumbling
verse, while angelfish nibble at our dropped metaphors.
In the Mascarene Islands, we will fly kites built from 
forest reeds and raffia palms until they are swallowed
by drifting winter clouds.
The return to a new day awaits us, and a thousand more
miles beneath our balloon before this life is drawn complete.
Awakening a memory, we close our eyes 
and the colors of life’s possibilities explode beneath our lids.

		The Prospector
		The meadow in winter;
		abandon nests,
		bleached bones of trees;
		no rain filling streams,
		brown tufts of
		prairie grass
		lay dormant atop red clay.
		beneath a gray
		cold sky…
		moon light casting
		shadows through
		spider webs sewn on
		winter shrubs.
		through the skeleton
		trees the north
		wind changes south
		a hidden distant horizon where
		images float;
		the feral herds graze
		tossing red-brown dust
		of drought.
		broken fences left eschew
		rusted wire collecting
		morning dew as
		tumbleweeds bury rotting
		birds with no wings.
		insects dance away
		from a rising sun and
		shadows scurry behind rabbits
		chasing their imagination
		on a lonely plain with
		few birds taking flight
		silhouetted
		against a distant mesa
		chimney rock; morning
		light strikes revealing
		a straw hat half buried in the sand.
		heat waves begin stirring a spring wind
		uncovering a truth.
		here bony fingers of a hand
		reaching to the amber sky
		above, below; a mesquite
		where a blank eyed
		skull watches a
		desert sparrow as
		she drinks early morning
		dew.

Gently singing,

	To the towns,

	Of the willows.
	And all reflections,
	Ripple calmly,
	Against the blue-grey wash,
	Of the sky.
	But as night,

	And sings along-
	The words,
	Melting into moonlight,
	And filling-
	Only the willing-

	And when it's song,

	The horizon chains,
	of the city,
	And once again,
	Stains, everything with
	Cold blood,
	A flood,
	Too spry,
	And mocking,
	For normality.
	Then quick as it came,
	The tame,
	Blue-grey,
	Rolls over the sunrise,
	And cries,
	To the city,
	To wake,
	And take,
	Their usually way about life.

	To the river,

	And watch the willows,

He is riven by the delta's whirl,
unable to disengage from the sandbar's grip,
his currents lost to an unknown tide.
He understands 
the secret language of Spanish moss and pleads 
for magnolias to fill his eyes once more.
Beneath nascent loam, his roots are tender,
seeking anchor.
Trailing through dark waters, his fingers 
discover sharp edges of shells, 
once containers of life, 
now bereft of a single notion
or an ocean's small sigh.
He weeps quietly as the moon rises in silent song; 
a burning wave of salt flows across his features
as if in afterthought, his sextant mislaid, perhaps even forgotten
as he remembers the seasonal paths of stars,
sculpting geography of countries he's never seen.

beat by seeds of water
thrown down on dread head

far ahead down below

rejoicing being filled
from so far away away away
down yonder way over yonder

go to a raging end of long road
splashing down babbling street brooks
mud tween toes as thunders roar
echo through bent trees wind branch whipping
hard drops at head into open mouth
not fast enough for a real draught
but just enough to tease the willing palate
tasting songs of birds wrapped in clapped thunder
offering lightninged flashes and cold cool warm showers
beating down depressed
repressed years of no-play re-plays
of when we was young ones
running after curtains falling
from high low cloud-springs
missing muddy feet and that deep
red dirt so good to eat
after the washing
smelling trees soaked to the knees
shoulders down crown down and around
front-back
hey that car slashed me as we both ran
to get to the puddle first i was last and that was the blast
as the geyser of water covered me
bone soaked and loving it to the bone
membering times when this was the way
a joy that the kid still lives not too deeply
close to the surface ready to emerge
like cicadas in july as i fly to the next
puddle to see if i can splash the car
before it me but i am purposely slow
to be soaked in splash and spring rained
to shower road water off crown
round shoulder to knees deep
deep in babbling streets brooked

ikeenadew drops of rain drip from brows
beat by seeds of water
thrown down on dread head
and i shake whats loose
that join companions
far ahead down below
rushing to a much too distant cup
rejoicing being filled
from so far away away away
down yonder way over yonder
as i skip very nearly a jump into puddles
and small rivers that grow
go to a raging end of long road
splashing down babbling street brooks
mud tween toes as thunders roar
echo through bent trees wind branch whipping
hard drops at head into open mouth
not fast enough for a real draught
but just enough to tease the willing palate
tasting songs of birds wrapped in clapped thunder
offering lightninged flashes and cold cool warm showers
beating down depressed
repressed years of no-play re-plays
of when we was young ones
running after curtains falling
from high low cloud-springs
missing muddy feet and that deep
red dirt so good to eat
after the washing
smelling trees soaked to the knees
shoulders down crown down and around
front-back
hey that car slashed me as we both ran
to get to the puddle first i was last and that was the blast
as the geyser of water covered me
bone soaked and loving it to the bone
membering times when this was the way
a joy that the kid still lives not too deeply
close to the surface ready to emerge
like cicadas in july as i fly to the next
puddle to see if i can splash the car
before it me but i am purposely slow
to be soaked in splash and spring rained
to shower road water off crown
round shoulder to knees deep
deep in babbling streets brooked
smile laughing at lightninged thunders
wonder still glinting in young old eyes

13,Mgreen,Wanderers,"The Nymph’s whisper 
awakens the weary wanders;
the melodic breeze loosens their sore backs.

Journeying, on the gypsy road, 
sifting through cruel and beautiful places,
with every new sight they take in, 
they witness moments.

A bearded storyteller
slowly moves his hand over a campfire;
his voice smooth as midnight. He entrances 
a little boy grinning with missing teeth.

A silver haired woman 
stands before her tribe,
pointing at a drawing in the dirt,
a wolf baying at the moon. 

A little girl
stares deeply into the palm 
of a newborn and promises 
 a long life for the little one.


A band of three
strum their string instruments,
couples stump their feet, and 
pick up on the merry jig.

A tall magician
twirls  his thumbs and a basket lifts 
off the ground, a curious woman
pokes at the oddity that continues to rise. 


People watch, wonder about, 
and wait for the wanderers
carried by the wind.

dissolve my eyes
in the reflexes of the water
while a long trail
of gaudy golden jewels
stole my mind",Nature
15,iridescentdea,moments musicaux,"thunder booms and echoes into the distance--
a timpanist's sforzando entrance and roll that diminuendos--
allowing the sound of rain to crescendo from the silence left behind;
fat drops patter against the roof and the porch and the leaves 
in increasing tempo，
culminating in sheets pounding against the poor earth 
and then--

	Along the meandering Highway 101,

	beams an old house in traditional white.
	Perched above the battered rocks on the jagged edge
	where two different worlds collide, stands Heceta Head,
	a remnant of a time forgotten.
	Swirling above the rugged coastal cliffs,
	a burst of gale scatters a fine gray mist.
	Salty samples of the sea cling to skin.
	Tidal strikes from the Pacific’s persistent depths
	clashes with Oregon’s steadfast rocks without rest.
	The constant bout records the pulse of time.
	Thunderous clouds riding on a passionate squall
	mass at sea to announce the impending rainfall.
	Others cower but Heceta stands ground.
	Drawn into the harsh turmoil of the stirring force,
	Father Time is hurled back on his historic course.
	In a bolt, a hundred years have vanished.
	In a moments blink, Heceta pulsates to life,
	As a searching light shimmers across the sky;
	A solitary guard called to duty.
	The water laps thirstily at the scanning beam.
	Swells of secrecy carries mysteries unseen.
	The voice of the sea is veiled by darkness.
	The arriving storm joins the assault against land,
	from the shadows emerges a crusty seaman.
	An old sturdy weather beaten phantom.
	Engrossed in deep thought, he puffs on his hand carved pipe.
	The man peers at his life’s long companion with pride.
	Timeless yarns breathe like the smoke he exhales.
	Observing the raging mood of the relentless sea,
	the old man proclaims, “Tonight there will be no sleep”.
	He silently curses the western wind.
	In reply, volleys of rain strikes the besieged shore.
	Thunder ripples from the mighty hammer of Thor,
	crushing the clamor for peace from the weary.
	Through a hundred prisms flickers a guiding flame,
	as outside nature releases a fierce refrain.
	The sea’s assault on the life of sailors is fought.
	The wind squeals, the sea swells, and the storm thrashes.
	But the man and his house stand stern till it passes.
	Storm and time pass yet Heceta remains.
	Man and house guide the forsaken through treacherous nights
	revealing the hidden lines where land and sea fight,
	a flare till they reach the light of day.
	Man advanced beyond their service as centuries pass.
	Yet the house still stands , another relict that lasts.

A faerie singing her sweet aria;
sublime euphony twirling and lilting in crystalline air
The Undine beneath the rippling waters also singing sweet
as the stars glimmer and dance amidst velutinous clouds
A full lambent moon gently illuminates the scene as from the magicked piano a butterfly flits from the smoothly coruscating notes and alights upon her head fluttering it's wings as if dancing
together they fill the heavens with their soft beauty as she begins to dance with the butterfly beside the undulating rindle that is enchanted to seem boundless
her fluid grace a reflection of the stream and a welcome accompaniment
as she whirls and twists the gusts of breeze formed by her motion are redolent of chilled orchid
with the sweet undertone of honeysuckle after a cleansing rain
as the song drifts  to an end the heavens smile tenderly and the faerie flies to the sky with the butterfly left behind, now perched on pianos edge still with pulsating wings and awaiting the next dance.

	Crawled out of the covers, expected snow

	Rain stopped on cue.
	I feel the gravel push against the sole of my shoes. Ashen reeds,
	pale ghosts against the brown leaves glistening with rain.
	She stopped
	at the top of the slope, a silhouette against the clouds.
	We were ghosts in the valley. Walked through
	banks of fog that drifted across the dam. I hoped she waited.
	She laughed with recognition as we materialized out of the fog.
	Hear her voice. A trilling harp weaving around the waking geese and ducks,
	who wait for the sun to burn away the fog -- take flight.
	When we joined her, she pointed down to the lake. The geese
	gathered, a cacophony of honking; began to race and lift off,
	broke through curtains of fog as they formed a vee. White light,
	the morning sun climbed above the hill, shrouded in clouds.
	Her arm twined with mine and the hatted head pressed against me.
	The dog pulled on the leash. My love rose to tiptoes and kissed me on the chin.
	I began to disappear into a sunny fog. Let my arms encircle her.
	The dog raced about us, tied us tightly against one another, stumbling,
	trying to stand still -- we found
	silence in a kiss and a heart beat.
	Later, as the last shreds of morning lingered by the front door,
	she let me know it was good I had caught up with her.
	It was better together than to walk alone. I held on,
	aware, lingering scents of cinnamon, nutmeg and fall.

Dawn peeks over the horizon after Summer's night
and feels the early stillness of grass laden with dew,
and songbirds on green steps to heaven
that brush a rippling mirror.
The bluebird sings summer, but then
a whisper of wind swings down from a frosty sky
and rushes through tall swamp grasses
that cling together at the coolness.
A flutter of wings fill a pine
as the songbirds spring in surprise
and silence their song at beginning notes
that follow the whispering wind,
and the wind wakes the oak from it's daze
and green answers the call and leaves in the waves
and Fall whispers, ""Come"".
A palette bows in response and dances on leaves,
casting its colors throughout the trees,
dabbing medium orange and yellow hues
on rolling green fields that sing harvest
in harmony with white-flashing deer
hiding themselves by ripened gold.
Red Light Hue leaps from the palette
and sprinkles like rain on forests and ground,
covering brown invading the green
and crunching under feet of laughter at play
that leaps into warm colored shapes.
The whisper of Fall in the swift, calling wind
follows the echoing Summer as it leaves the stage
and nature sings the dance of the palette.

27,Meadow-Lark,Party of Two,"A night gown emerged
from winter’s shadow,
and moved swiftly through the icy black,
carefully sidestepping mechanical sticks
fallen from the skeletons of old oak trees
and crushed under merciless tires.

Skin, neatly dressed with bruises
concealed her lower face 
and flamboyantly cascaded
across her arms.
Under her jaw,
were the two small hands
of a child grasping onto her neck,
as if it was driftwood
and he was stranded at sea.

She leaned forward,
carrying him through the torrent of
ice and snow,
like a mother salmon
traveling upstream
between filters 
of empty soda cans
and broken bottle shards-

beyond the stop sign that cuts off
southeast fragrance avenue
from strawberry lane
on a naked winter night.

I always tend to write poems sometime during the day, right after writing it I hate it. Then I go back and read it again, and I love it. Then I look for ways to improve it.

Poetry is not dead
It has not been seen in silk-lined coffins
or seen in the ICU gasping for final breaths
not in the ER with a concussion or a severed artery 
or in the alley, left unconscious by a stockbroker's 
well-placed punch or a drunk's misplaced anger
It does not whimper in shadowed corners
or cry for help from distracted strangers
It does not beg for bread or soup or debate or alms
but it might break into song
in an unexpected moment
It does not care for currency 
or validation from upturned noses
or retreat to dusty shelves of libraries
turned into museums instead of concert halls
It appreciates silent thought and quiet philosophies
offered by open hands flowering with kindness
not closed minds full of gray impenetrable fog
It does not dress for dinner or pay heed to idle gossip 
the latest celebrity's faux pas or felony or who disappeared last week
It won't pay their bail or represent them in a court of irrelevant peers
It is not a smiling anchor reciting untold horrors
bright teeth gleaming madly at disastrous headlines
One may find it at water's edge
eagerly anticipating a child's homemade boat to sail
or the first smooth stone they've ever skipped
laughing as it makes ripples in warm currents
concentric circles to travel around an eventual world
yet it may hum slow jazz rhythms snapping fingers
as the world's pulse begins anew with rising light

It is only waiting

Note, November 26th, 2014:
I deleted several comments because of my lengthy replies, trying to 
explain my poem - in a civil way - and how it wasn't all about puppies 
and rainbows. (I deleted other replies I'd left because my friends got 
my messages - this has nothing to do with them.) When the comments 
become longer than the poem, that's just wrong on so many levels - 
and I shouldn't have to defend my writing from any perspective or 
point on the compass anyway. My husband said I was wasting my 
time. He was right - and I don't have any to spare. It is what it is, 
it is what I say it is when it comes to my own writing. Poetry is 
both objective and subjective - and it does not adhere to any set of 
rules. If someone has a different opinion, then let them write their 
own poem instead of criticizing mine. I don't do ""poetry by committee"".
I am not ""opinionated"" or ""age-biased"" as was suggested, either. 
Yes, I do have my own opinions about things - and I earned the right 
to them all - but I'm not obnoxious about it and I don't try to convert 
anyone, either. Many of my favorite writers and readers range from 
12 years old up to some in their 90's. I've been writing since 1973 and 
moved out on my own when I was 16 - my poetry continues to evolve, 
as do I. There is no great mystery here - and it ain't rocket science, either.

searching for Douglas fir.

Wet lumps of snow slipped into my boots

while we trudged behind 
begging each tree to turn into a Douglas fir.
They remained unworthy. 
I laid down and rolled over the crust 
for a spell while dad cussed the bush
for being so ornery.
It felt as if we’d travelled ten miles
when we heard him holler “Eureka!”
He yelled that when things were good.
There it was, a fine specimen indeed,
or so dad said. 
It looked like any sturdy, straight arrow,
small tree laden with pillows of snow.
Dad flapped his arms with glee
and then exclaimed,  
“Damnation!  I forgot the axe!”
Later, he chopped down a blue spruce
close to the road and then slowly drove home.
None of us paid no mind to the white lie
he told our mother while we were drinking cocoa

murmurings of passersby beneath my window
mix with the noises and smells from the shops below,
drifting through the winding caverns,
of the narrow cobblestone streets.
 
The accumulated raindrops flow
like a raging torrent through the rooftop gutters. 
Two scraping umbrellas 
passing in the same space
along the narrow walkway. 
 
Laying in my bed, absorbing-
the piercing cries of babies,
church bells chiming out the hour,
barking dogs, screeching cats,
the loud, very loud, lyrical Italian,
at times romantic and enticing,
spoken in tones of conversation, yet
to the untrained ear, 
sounding like cries of desperation
in the final throes of life.
 
The smells, oh god the smells-
the breezes off the Ligurian Sea carrying
onion and garlic sauteing,
sausages, pork, and lamb gently frying,
the open air fish market around the corner,
all hanging in the air,
creating an invisible cloud
shrouding 2500 years of existence.
 
Monterosso, isolated when the rains come,
the seas roughen, the ferrys rock at their dock, 
the cobblestone glazed over as if iced.
Trains halt the exodus to Milan, Florence, Venice-
trapped in paradise-
dampened by the intermittent rains,
overpowered by the quaintness and charm
of a simpler life.

	I stand at my front door, past the cement walk, head tilted up just a bit,
	enough to see the mountains that surround us; Job's peak, powdered with snow.
	The air is cold and crisp, I fill my lungs with gratitude. I love it here.
	Peaceful, is the first word that comes to mind. 
	The sky is sometimes leaden, filled with clouds. But that is just winter, growling it's warning.
	 Mostly, the skies are content, and shine with a clear, blue smile.  I, too, am content.
	At peace with my surroundings.  Winter comes, and goes.
	It is spring.
	I gaze past the cement walk out of my front door and see lavender. It grows everywhere, surrounding the stately aspens which my street is named after. The white bark on the trees is peeling in places as the trees grow out of their clothes. The mountainside is dotted with orange and purple, marked in splotches of baby blue. A few puffy white clouds change shape as a warm breeze shifts them around.
	Spring takes a vacation, and it is summer.
	Hot is the word that comes to mind. Then, again, the smell of lavender. I often ask under my breath why my street is not named for that. It grows everywhere. I clip it back and make use of it in lavender cookies, and lavender lemonaide. A small cafe down the road uses it in salad dressing. 
	Delicious is the word that comes to mind. Summer moves on, trying to escape it's own heat.
	It is autumn. Beautiful autumn.
	Russet, burnished copper, and lovely, brilliant yellow.  A few shades of green have yet to be kidnapped and cling to branches stubbornly. 
	There is the slight haze from chimney smoke. I love the smell of it as it combines with the aroma of damp, decaying leaves.
	The perfume of winter as it makes it's approach.

 Because there are no mountains in central Texas, One of the first things I noticed when I moved to Oregon was the clouds on the mountainside near my home ( because a mountain was just about 300 yards way from my front porch ) and just as the sun began coming up, the clouds would start to move over the top of the ridge line and begin to actually trickle down through the tall fir, spruce and pine trees like some kind of white gas pouring through the lower parts of the trees leaving the tops of the trees visible as it poured all the way to the bottom of the mountain through the trees into the fields at the bottom  into the apple orchards. It amazed me and it still does. I don't think it can be accurately be put in words like the song ""The star spangled banner"" is so descriptive. but I tried....and that's ""the rest of the story""..so to speak. I've got a poem about a guy who stepped on the face of a bull elk who was trying to sleep while the guy was out hunting mushrooms ( a big business here) It's quite a romantic poem too but in a more warlike fashion, I'll post it sometime soon. it's about mountains as well....hahahaha. ©  on Sep 13 2014 04:14 AM, Nathan Simmons   nature  • misc5     ",Nature

	Uncertain, sure of all uncertainties.

I am watching it all,

taste of winter. In my mind's eye:
the deep greens and subtler hues
fading to brown, drying up,
the short blades of grass
pricking the soles of my stubbornly bare feet,
knowing that in due time, drifts of snow
will cover all that is left of now. My ears
are preparing for the day when they will
be bent to the laboring creak of
ice-burdened limbs, fixed upon the splintering crack,
the chuffing thud of branches,
falling to the snow-smothered ground below.

Such insidious gray thoughts are snatched away
by the appearance of a swallow-tailed butterfly.
Slower than the hastening summer and onrushing winter,
he gently makes his way from leaf to blossom,
in a logical path he alone chooses, in full knowledge
of the passing of his season of glory.
So vivid the colors -- the tints and shades
of his first morning still shine on his last.
I wonder at such persistence through the
fraying nicks of daily struggle,

constant push and pull against the wayward
currents of air -- of his split and tattered wings.",Nature

55,Jude Kyrie,Summer Storms,"
Between the heat wave and the storm.
Is the sultry humid air drenched in water,
unable to hold its moisture
for a second longer.
A moment of silence beyond stillness.
In the distance the thunder is grumbling
drumrolls miles from here but coming now.
The darkness and the rain
bouncing high from the pavement.
Electrical discharges
crackle as the air explodes.
Looking out of the window
At a cataract of waterfall torrents.
The buildings of the city distorted
like reflections in a hall of mirrors.
Inside the air conditioner creaking
And groaning at its impossible task.
The thunder is now overhead
Filling the room with odor of ozone
 water flows in rivers to the
overloaded storm drains
The coolness after the humid air
is drained feels so wonderful.
I think if I ever have to die
I want it to be in a storm like this.
Naked in the rain
 as it washes away my sins.
And my maker
roars his forgiveness.

	Whispers come from the two intruders on the beach
	Laughter spiraling up into the dusky evening
	Telling of secrets and jokes and the coming of an end
	To conscience
	Red-orange fingers reach for her
	The breeze darting into her ears
	Telling her things she doesn’t wish to hear
	Of chastity and waiting
	But they are short lived
	Her choices are made
	Daringly flung into Fate’s ribbon
	She listens to the crash of sea against rocks instead
	Ebbing and flowing
	Foam tossed into the air like a babe
	The red of warning departs, sunset replaced by
	The deep stage of night
	Stars tossed into the velvet sash of the evening
	The props set, the cove quiet
	Just two of them and the shadows of doubt
	Of half a mind to just sleep instead
	The heady feeling of confidence disappearing
	Under his gaze
	His fingers skim the warmth of her hip
	“You are beautiful.”
	It is murmured against the soft smoothness
	Of her belly
	Her level thoughts scatter in the pull
	Of a dance as old as time itself
	The barest hint of the moon’s rim
	Watches down as bodies arc
	And in a field of hazy almost-dreams
	Good-byes are said to innocence.

57,cherylline,children of the desert,"where the lands have set
a dim haze rests on the paled viridian;
crisped, and browned, little leaf
ends curled in protective defence
or perhaps defiance -

in a bleached world of fine sands.
white scarves of mist eddy, endlessly, upward
warm curtains draw softly back,
receding to paint dew on wilting heads -
sweet and gentle as a mother's grief-gone,
love-lorn kiss.
pieta.
red green blue pink purple yellow orange
desert roses dying in the sunrise
mauve lilac champagne copper brandy dried gold
as if drunk, or crazed, all of a sudden,
stems unclench into a last lament, and dance.

petals whisk stirringly in a threadbare breeze
that changes the face of the homeland;
memory inverts, sea-change in sandy seas.
crystal cotton diffracts into the air
slowly gently murmur quiet kiss me up farewell borne by the arms
of a nursemaid draft, passed into the elbow
of a light east wind, and hushed into patient repose.
fluttering over fallen flower fields, passed from old parent
to new, they whisper on an echo beyond awareness
and are reborn unto themselves.

sand and seed, desert children, sing
glide, and dip, and rise, twirl
flow, and follow, and twist, unfurl
and so, search, seek, so hesitantly
come to new home.

leave the lands of the family.

inching along suspensions of hope and memory,
alone now, swept out and away.
time after time, the mists carry precious offspring, harry
generation after generation of quiet love and loss
onto the last of the red fields,
where amongst the dying, will new lives again
be bequeathed to the wind,
and sacrificed to the sand.i was uncertain about how to break this down. i had problems on stanzas, lines, sentences, and whether to keep it whole or not. so it might be overworked - i'd be glad to receive additional comment on the style.
the idea for this was born from a National Geographic feature on desert life, we watched in school. the images were so breathtakingly powerful and beautiful, i had to write this, and write it while the images were fresh. so in the next class i wrote it hands, pen and paper in my desk, hiding behind the textbook.

	yet supported us on the steep decline.
            Swing dancing, and at

           I chased you on the playground,

	from the dock, onto the rocky shore, barricaded by the steep cliff,
	littered with climbing vines and coke cans.

	There, we collected rocks,
	and experimented,
	launching and flinging them over the ice.
       You shifted.
	Some hopped a few times, others exploded to dust and pebbles,
	as others impaled themselves in the surface,
	stuck sideways,
	sticking in the water
	and sticking out.
        I guess you didn’t know any better.
	The big rocks sank right through the ice,

	When a careless step stamps on the dry ground…

	To the graffiti written on a prison wall; mindless, frustrated scribbling. 

	  

	In the somber graveyard, where everything seems stilled, even trees, 

	On a soccer ball mercilessly hit, it hears loud cheers and feels giddy. 

	  

	In the air-conditioned conference room atop the projector’s lens, 

	Amid mad, honking vehicles on the road (they say it’s ‘traffic sense’). 

	  

	In the concert on a saxophonist’s shoulder, it enjoys the arpeggios, 

	On a mountaintop, aboard a rucksack, it feels the cold and the snow.

	On a sealskin canoe on the pole, 

	To a femme fatale’s facial mole. 

	On the jet at supersonic speed,  

	To that betted, black fast steed. 

	On the head of the new born infant, 

	To the comfortable cushion of the coffin… 

	  

	Tireless, it yearns for more, 

	Never bored and never sore…

basket, from the languid pools where they gather
pretty as mushroom stools. Pearly droplets of 
morning dew gush in rivulets down the soft velvet
of a newly blossomed rose, making her blush a
deep shade of pink. Fragile ferns gloriously scent
the wind from their earmarked patch, their tender
tendrils reminding me of his curly hair falling upon
his broad forehead, tumbling over his seashell ears
as he shakes his head in a masculine laugh with me.

Gingham dresses are suddenly the new in-thing, along
with a checked apron and a lace cap and flat shoes with
rubber soles, because he loves seeing me in these. Long
hair in two long braids is in, and so is picking blackberries
in fernsy, intoxicatingly scented woods, for that is where
he studies me all day. I spent yesterday evening darning the 
stockings I ripped climbing up the grand old oak, where 
I found the magic of a kiss yet again, and shivered 
in the summer wind at his breezy kiss upon my neck.

Cocky Robin Red-breast twitters at me from my window 
sill, and when I’m ready, leads me to where playful
sunshine is – in the woods, where he waits for me, 
with a halo of damp black curls on his brow. Austere tulips 
nod sagely purple heads at impertinent squirrels, who squeak
at impish petunias and bubbly buttercups, all joining
the overflowing mushrooms of thoughts in my woody
basket. Languorous kisses trail upon my bare skin, my crazed
heart thumping within my chest, while a lazy hand rests right 
where I’ve tattooed his name upon me. The ink will stay forever.  ©  ",Nature

.
Humid days found me with scissors in the garden, 
cutting tall stems gently, helping my mother fill coffee cans 
with water, then with tulips, daffodils and chrysanthemums. 
We drove, then walked for hours, pausing to put one can each 
upon the final beds of those whose names I did not recognize, 
for relatives I knew only from fading photographs. 
Evergreens and pines scented the air as ground squirrels ran furiously
to scurry from our sight, then raise from their burrows inquisitively,
wondering why we were slowly spreading color across parched dirt.
I knew to step carefully between rows and whisper with respect; 
although I thought no one was listening, I could never be too sure.
Silently, my mother would wipe a tear from her sun-blushed cheek;
I would gently take her hand and hold it between my own,
unable to understand her sorrow - she'd stroke my hair, 
murmur about the inevitable passage of years, 
mourning shadows the dusk could not hide from her eyes. 
                                      
Even now, I remember the weight of a cloudless sky
as her shoulders bent beneath the heft of unspoken memories -
then, she would sigh and say it was time to go, 
leaving behind those who'd already gone ahead long before, 
marking trails we could not follow. 
On the way home, we were quiet, each lost in our own thoughts. 
Decades later, without her hands and wisdom to guide me, 
there have been far too many places to visit
and never enough flowers to cover these expanding fields.

across meadows up in the hills magnificent grizzly bears winter coats are shed.

life stolen by a bleak winter, is breathed back by springs warming sun rays,
as foxes crawl up from a three month slumber 
to hunt and reclaim their lands once more
as night slowly follows this elegant spring day.

75,WandaLeaBrayton,The Fedora: For My Father,"
Beneath his stern visage, there was still a light in his eyes, becoming 
dimmed by circumstances seemingly beyond his control -
he wore a Fedora with a black band of velvet, something soft
to soothe his tumbling thoughts, perhaps. On those few days
he was off work, he wore a suit, a broad silk tie knotted smartly 
at his collar, tinged slightly pink and paled 
with the fading promise of a rose.
His masculinity was never an issue, believe me. Anyone 
who drove cross-country between the 1920's and the 1970's 
had earned, the hard way, their stripes for bravery, for endurance,
for not putting up with any guff from anyone, no matter 
how tough they might be - even gangsters, union busters, you name it,
he had to deal with the fallout of such civic-minded uprisings,
let alone the drowsy drone of the road.
I saw a movie from long ago where Bogie was in such a predicament,
amazed by his tenacity and fearlessness, facing imminent danger.
I reconsidered my father then - what he must have gone through
in order to make it home in one piece. Once, he took my mother 
with him, to the East Coast. Not really a vacation, but she saw the sights. 
They brought back a large brown grocery sack - I pondered its contents
with a child's insatiable curiosity. They'd gone to the plant 
in Hershey, Pennsylvania and some kind foreman had opened 
the broad spout, spilling out a dark Niagra Falls of chocolate. 
I danced with delight, savoring each chunk as though 
it was manna from heaven. It was, and he had delivered it.
He drove for 49 years without incident, until one day, a sudden 
burst of wind tipped over his rig and slid it sideways along the highway. 
He was knocked unconscious, badly gashing his head and when he came to, 
he realized the truck and its contents were on fire. 
With his pointed-toe cowboy boots, he kicked out the windshield 
and ran through flames, holding his breath and perhaps, thinking of his family 
waiting for him to arrive, hoping and pleading he'd make it. Blistered and raw, 
his clothes stuck to his skin, he was stitched and gauzed at the hospital, 
then sent home to recover. I sometimes wonder if he ever really did. 
When he drove up, I was outside, trembling, forgetting every angry word
that had crept between us. He patted my arm, insisting he was alright,
it really wasn't as bad as it looked. I wanted to believe him, I did - 
yet, I'd already been exposed to loss and grief and its weight 
was as heavy on my shoulders as his bandaged hand. 
I couldn't seem to form the words, utter the sounds to say 
I was proud of him, I loved him, I was so glad he made it home,
but I suspect he knew by looking into my deep brown eyes 
that were so much like his own. 
The next time we all went out to dinner, a rare and wondrous event, 
I shyly handed him his Fedora. He put it on gingerly, 
the scar still visible and tender, then adjusted its brim 
with a smooth gesture of his fingers. 
I had never admired him more.

as silk

THE DUNNOCK
In brittle silence of a frosted morn
he sang; a song of coloured notes
that shivered hoar from crooked branch,
and trembled on the crusted spider's web.
A rainbow song, now tinting dawn's
first misted breath with subtle hues
of golden days to come.
How drab this bird, this Pan, that
called the drowsy Snowdrops from their
sleep and piped sweet-smelling
Jasmine's wayward climb.  How dull
his livery of grey and brown,
engraved against the rising
sun's weak light.
He hid among entangled twigs and
sang, until it seemed, his
heart, like swollen buds,
would burst, cascading
heated passion on the ground
and melt cold earth to
crocus-coloured hues.
How the Mother Earth
did smile, as
she gave this modest
envoy of the Spring,
all her subtle colours
to his song.

When we were still 
a dwelling within ourselves, 
together, 
we scattered seeds in shadows 
upon a parched, neglected yard,
dancing through sprays of water,
lithe and luminous beneath a smiling moon.
Later, you planted tea roses for me
and I planted gladiolus for you.
Somehow, several bulbs tilted under the soil, 
their stems crawling slowly across the garden, 
horizontal and confused. 
I could not understand this strange leaning.
The next bulb to break through
twisted its own stalk, rising, 
then curved into the shape of a C-clamp;
finally, it stood straight and tall, 
laughing at the horizon 
as pastel blooms unfurled.
In the boldness of dawn, 
we found a blue caterpillar
inching its way beside this determined stalk,
tiny in proportion, yet immense in meaning.
I had never seen such brightness 
before or since,
not even in dreams.

True story ...
Picture from Google images
I was especially inspired by this line of Plath's poem:
""And I want the one's longevity and the other's daring.""
I Am Vertical by Sylvia Plath
But I would rather be horizontal.
	I am not a tree with my root in the soil
	Sucking up minerals and motherly love
	So that each March I may gleam into leaf,
	Nor am I the beauty of a garden bed
	Attracting my share of Ahs and spectacularly painted,
	Unknowing I must soon unpetal.
	Compared with me, a tree is immortal
	And a flower-head not tall, but more startling,
	And I want the one's longevity and the other's daring.

	Tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,
	The trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors.
	I walk among them, but none of them are noticing.
	Sometimes I think that when I am sleeping
	I must most perfectly resemble them—
	Thoughts gone dim.
	It is more natural to me, lying down.
	Then the sky and I are in open conversation,
	And I shall be useful when I lie down finally:
	Then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me.

The dandelions in the moment and then
By: CJ Evans

It is. And needles don’t fall;
cones don’t fall. The soil keeps

holding the grass seed and the dune
sand beneath is still torn by thirsty,

wooden hands. By bedrock
is where will be my tenoned pine.

And the grass seeds don’t split,
their shoots don’t spill. The clouds

remain, widely. That locked closet
inside will never have its tumblers

turned. Honestly, all I had
was the only lie—that I could be

the one who evades. Sparrows
don’t fall, no owl falls. Left behind

are her thin hands, a box full
of ribbons, a bolt, a knife.

Photographs with anybody’s faces.
Hungry letters, angry letters about

a time and people and love that is
not. No image holds its meaning

within itself. Not one dandelion fell.

Lifting up the fallen leaves
Whistling through unkempt hair
Steaming the breath in front
Raising goose bumps all over the body;
Blue lips silently praying,
Hands rubbing together, for warmth
Limbs contracted inside to heat up
The body huddled, head bowed
Against the cold - the solitary light
Not enough, never against
The rising chill, the creeping shadows,
Cold fear that freezes the bones
And runs down the spine - 
The body turns to stone, 
A solitary statute stationed
Frozen on the bench, waiting
All alone, so cold.

103,liquidmindforever,Bare Table," Matthew 6:19-24


    long ago
on this side of Marlowe's Mountain
in Appalachia, lost to the world, 
a lone
old veteran
living in the woods, found a stash of squirrel
acorns, fallen leaves, and an arms
length of rancid hunks of grizzly bone;

he stuffed the acorns into his tattered pocket
padded his bare blistered feet with moist peat
then dug around for the rusted fork he'd found
on the hardened ground, but couldn't find it;
(some critter musta' snatched it 
 some time ago, during winter's sleep)
   
    so he
stuck his chaffed and frost-bitten tongue
into a turkey vulture's leftover meal and sucked
the slimy blood-drenched marrow as best he could,
but it had dried.

    he lit
his last book of matches on some dried leaves
to warm himself, tossing a handful of acorns
into the mound of sizzling hissing leaves
so he could feed on nature's fare, fallen table.

    the old vet
knew treasure when he saw it - he knew
Nature could provide for him what mankind
never could - and that rusty old fork
(he seemed to have lost)
still lies gathering moss and rust
for the next sojourner, hungry
to taste the bare luxury of nature's table.

116,YesterdaysDreams,Promise of Spring,"    I awoke this morning to the singing of the birds.  Bright sunlight streaming in my window, falling over me with warm caressing fingers.  The promise of the approaching spring called out in bird chatter. A smile brightens up the room and comes to rest in my eyes.  As feet touch the cool wood floor, scents of coffee waft in currents of sun beams.  As I savor the mornings first breaths, gazing out the window I am brought back to my youth.  My mother and I trimming down the roses.  Cutting away the dead gnarled stems to allow new growth for the season.  As we were doing this a bird called out loud and mellifluous over her head.  Her long blue black hair caught in the breeze and eddied around her as though it had a life of its own.  Her eyes following the bird to its nest, she smiled and the world became radiant.  She leaned in close, her hair whispering against my small face, her scent of sandalwood and roses gathering me into her comfort.  ""Do you know what that bird was saying?"", she said.  I shook my head, no. ""Spring is here.""  She answered. ©  on Mar 11 2009 11:45 AM, Kimberly Dupree   life  • love  • nature   ",Nature

119,Randaloph,'Songs of the Forest',"
	In the far Western wilderness where wild dark rivers run
	from mighty mountains, you’ll hear the songs of the forest sung,
	hear creatures in the undergrowth where filtered light is dim,
	while high upon the canopy, the tunes the song birds sing.
	Hear the rhythm of the rain in harmony with the wind,
	cheerful chorus of new life in the forest’s song of spring
	the song of rushing water as it craves a taste for salt
	and the silent song, the spirit of ancient native folk.
	In hallowed halls of government another song is heard,
	it’s the song of dam the rivers, of nature undisturbed
	in the quest for hydro power, the cleanest science can
	bring jobs to the people, spread its wealth throughout the land.
	Hear the song of the diggers, of the dozers and the trucks
	in the symphony of progress, the song of bolts and nuts
	the chorus of the contractors, they sing their song of hope
	to form a lake so long, so large, they see their dreams afloat.
	Down in pubs and on the streets there’s a bolder melody,
	it’s a song of save the forests and leave the rivers free,
	it’s a song of people power, a song of discontent,
	it is the song of protest with the threat of consequence.
	In the Western wilderness still, as wild dark rivers run
	from mighty mountains you’ll hear the songs of the forest sung,
	the song of water ever rushing to sate its lust for salt,
	feel the song, that is the spirit of ancient native folk.
	From 1978-83 Tasmania was the scene of the largest environmental campaign ever staged in Australia, the battle to prevent the Gordon and Franklin River valleys being flooded for the purpose of hydro-electricity. A conflict fought in the pubs on the streets, on the rivers and in the halls of government, it generated world wide interest and had a feeling of civil war as families and friends were split by their allegiance to the different factions. Eventually after high court challenges and the fall of governments the project was halted.
	The Wild Rivers National Park was formed as result of the campaign and the area (uninhabited wilderness-rain forest) was declared a World Heritage area and remains protected today.

	the chorus of the contractors, they sing their song of hope

	to form a lake so long, so large, they see their dreams afloat.

	 

	Down in pubs and on the streets there’s a bolder melody,

	it’s a song of save the forests and leave the rivers free,

	it’s a song of people power, a song of discontent,

	it is the song of protest with the threat of consequence.

	 

	In the Western wilderness still, as wild dark rivers run

	from mighty mountains you’ll hear the songs of the forest sung,

	the song of water ever rushing to sate its lust for salt,

	feel the song, that is the spirit of ancient native folk.

	 
	From 1978-83 Tasmania was the scene of the largest environmental campaign ever staged in Australia, the battle to prevent the Gordon and Franklin River valleys being flooded for the purpose of hydro-electricity. A conflict fought in the pubs on the streets, on the rivers and in the halls of government, it generated world wide interest and had a feeling of civil war as families and friends were split by their allegiance to the different factions. Eventually after high court challenges and the fall of governments the project was halted.

	The Wild Rivers National Park was formed as result of the campaign and the area (uninhabited wilderness-rain forest) was declared a World Heritage area and remains protected today.   ©  on Apr 17 2015 10:11 PM   conflict  • history  • nature  • storytelling     ",Nature
120,PenAllen,Blueberry Pack - Sestina,"
Driving home on the cusp of spring
there was a haloed pale moon.
Our motor didn’t muffle the howl
of winds that shaped the snowdrift.
The headlights caught curious eyes
staring back with no promise of peace.
Winters are hard up north in the Peace.
Hunger robs the wolves of their spring.
Everywhere there are keening eyes
captured by the curve of the moon.
Through shadows. silhouettes drift
without their signature howl.
In the fields, coyotes still howl
away any hope of peace.
In the willow windrow drift
her den holds inklings of spring.
By the glimmer of a sickle moon,
she whelps her litter of blind eyes.
Safe from savage scavenging eyes
they listen to the pack leader howl.
Their mother’s milk fattens the moon
and flows into plumped up peace.
They belly-roll, scamper and spring
while the puppy dream-times drift.
Her yearnings being to drift
away from the stares of hungry eyes.
Her muscles have lost their spring
and she aches to run wild and howl.
Weaning won’t bring any peace
but she’ll cavort beneath the moon.
I saw them last full moon
on the Blueberry ditch and drift.
They were heading down to the Peace
with a cool cruel glint in their eyes.
On the ridge, they gathered to howl
and one spun on its axis mid-spring
When winter's moon wanes in the Peace,
break-up will spring out of snowdrift.
We recall amber eyes when we hear them howl.

I stand in a field covered in icing.It was not sticky but just soft.It felt like snow and it melted in my hands.
I looked up and saw a tree covered in vanilla snow.I looked closer and saw one red apple sitting on its branches.
I turned around and suddenly the snow turned cold.and the snow tasted plain, like nothing.
I started to shiver, the snow was freezing.
The apple fell from its tree and turned into a acorn.Then I realized that i'm not in a field.But this is just my backyard.
I sat and lay in the snow, then looked to the sky.""Why does every thing change?""

Their heads tilted to one side
Entranced
She looks up, silver eyes closing
Her round face ivory in the moonlight
All is silent, then,
A flash - time in standstill
Her hair slicing through the air
A bead of sweat rolling down her neck
All muscles taut, each beautifully shaped,
A marble statue, moving back her bow smoothly,
It crackles and releases,
Sending three arrows to her left
They cut through the night,
Drawing blood and cries
As they reach their destinations
She rises, a smile sketched upon her lips

The canines freeze,

Their heads tilted to one side

Entranced

	 

She looks up, silver eyes closing

Her round face ivory in the moonlight

All is silent, then,

A flash - time in standstill

Her hair slicing through the air

A bead of sweat rolling down her neck

All muscles taut, each beautifully shaped,

A marble statue, moving back her bow smoothly,

It crackles and releases,

Sending three arrows to her left

They cut through the night,

Drawing blood and cries

As they reach their destinations

132,Ron Wiseman,Taking a Narrow Road to Winter,"
	Sounds of Winter . . . yes, that is the prompt. As Shakespeare was fond of doing in a few of his sonnets, I have used the broad metaphor of the seasons for a person's life. Most of us live unremarkable lives and others live on through their genes, works both written and enacted and in the memories of others.  Many a farmer has farmed on as his own father did before him, etc. I've seen this happen myself. It is rather a narrow road, this unprogressive choice. 
	 

	 

	The icy blast calls to us all

	on a narrow road, or broad.

	 

	He took the narrow road

	to a past era 

	he pretended was true worth,

	with bush blooms he knew by scent 

	drifting by morning fields.

	 

	If he were romantic,

	this was as deep as it got! 

	 

	He turned sods of earth before afternoon 

	and by milking time his callused hands,

	softened by vasoline, 

	were enabled all the better 

	to squeeze milk from full udders

	into steel buckets.. 

	 

	In the eyes of his wife 

	he was his own slave 

	and there he stayed

	for the remnant of his days 

	hearing what he wanted to hear

	until the afternooning of his life 

	when he could no longer 

	hoe his cultivation,

	nor the baked-dry soil 

	of his vegetable beds.

	 

	He left his the farm, 

	once his wife died--

	struck by lightning 

	by the flooded-gum tree--

	to their indolent and only son.

	 

	His home, his acres, all were left 

	there--to rust, rot and ruin. 

	 

	He died, not a moment to soon 

	nor a moment too late 

	in an old people's home.

	 

	Some say he lingered there

	among the blind, deaf and forgetful

	but he saw himself as a wild oat 

	waving a green banner

	in a field of corn, 

	always mindful, in all of this 

	cultivation, of the reaper's 

	scythe. . .  and so it was.

	 

	It is winter and its sounds

	blow over a mound 

	with a brass plate 

	that says, 'Ever at Rest'--

	with his dates, that is all--

	just one stubborn farmer the less.

	 

	For,  the blast holds us, awed,

	on a narrow road, or broad.

A quiet breeze ruffled trees from their moonlit calm.
Beyond them,  and higher, lies a midnight-blue sky
vaguely etched with starry constellations and they,

We listen. The tiny trickle of a nearby spring tickles
my meditative thoughts. Suddenly, far-away, 
a lone dingo howls, perhaps at the full moon,

through dark scrub and bush into the pool
down by the spring. We, stargazing lovers,
cling, like lost children, to each other's 
comforting arms, whispering charms.
Out it comes, looming large and strange.

the arms of the morning, the lover
that cradled the portentous day
have broken their hold – part and retreat -
to reveal the afternoon 
running unclothed on the hillside
               slight, sickly
forming shadows to crouch in.

A tree is speaking – its vowels
drip out of silences and surrender
when, stolen by the breeze -
like the ghosts of leaves
that unnoticed are forgotten;
they abandon their bodies
              sensuous, supine
to the freefall of the moment.

My companion now – a beech
of knotted magnitude; its consonants
creak over the dancing grass –
wet with perpetual dew. 
Although ubiquitous in the branches
lie the shades of an old life
             slumberous, silent
I was here first - regardless I remain. ",Nature

	A blue dress stands out against the moving leaves.
	Reaching up she holds a limb and swings her feet,

	She laughs as she climbs.
	A moving world of green,
	A thousand shades,
	Leaves brushing her face,
	Twigs catching her clothes.
	Twenty feet below,
	Infinity above,
	She climbs on,
	Seeming to dance as she twists and turns,
	Whirls and spins,
	Joy of life,
	Happiness and freedom,
	Carefree and light as the wind and the leaves.
	Thirty feet up,
	There's no stopping her now,
	She knows what she's doing,
	She's not afraid.
	The height is nothing to her,
	She needs to breathe the air the birds breathe,
	The fairies are calling her,
	Guiding her to the top,
	And she herself becoming more fairy-like the higher she gets.
	A sprite, dancing,
	A brownie, weaving,
	A nymph, a dryad,
	An elf, spiralling through the leaves.
	Forty feet, she's almost there,
	A breath of wind curls through her yellow hair,

	Her voice joins the birdsong.
	Fifty feet! She's there at last!

I tread on soft blue moss and cool pebbles, shadowed ‘neth the Weeping Willow trees.
Lingering fingers, I brush my hands over the yellow tulips' lemon dust, in tender sanctity.
I breathe in air so sweet and pure, and luxuriate in the filling of my lungs, fulfilled.
I gaze, as flies the dragon and the butter, dancing to the lofty trills of the Whippoorwill.
I shrug the clothes from my body, falling away as an afterthought on this mystical walk.
I indulge in easy rhythm of air and scent, as it roams free, wandering, my own skin, upon.
I come to an outcropping of great boulders, dressed in a hundred hues of silver and gray.
I rest my hand on these rocks, profound, as I feel their pulse and touch of warmth, assuaged.
I continue on this pathway, twirling in wonder, as joyful reverie seeps into my excited feet.
I enter the opening between the Willows and neighborly blue Hyacinth, stepping indiscreet.
Before me, a tiny meadow lays yielding, rich green, a pasture made to lie down upon.
Beyond the grass is a river, slowly flowing south, shimmering magical in the now bright sun.
Flowers abound, encircling the meadow, and I gaze upon crimson Azaleas and Periwinkle vines.
Dripping are the Wisteria trees, golden Honeysuckle lianas, and climbing white Lilies, vastly refined.
I take my first step onto this divine pasture, gentle cooling arising between my toes, as I dance.
I make my way to the river, lying down on the edge of the spongy soft meadow, entranced.
The sun warms my body, as it eagerly shares its array of shining rays with the river, sparkling.
I reach out my arm to the channel, dipping my fingers into the crystal waters, tinkling.
I gaze in wonder as sparkles, river befriended, climb my fingers, encompassing hand, silkily.
There comes with this spreading, a shift, from earthly agony to an unearthly tranquility.
The healing water lends itself to me, as sparkles cover my entire body, calm within and out.
I rest in slumber, under that kindly sun, rays mixed with gleams, mirrored throughout.
My breathing slows, as does heart, while I join the river, flowing high, consecrated celestial.
I glance back one last time, whispering to the Willows, “weep for me no more,” ethereal.

151,Kt Stevenson,My Personal Helicon,"
As a child, they could not keep me from climbing,
The trees around our house proved no match
But the old twisted oak in the overgrown forest
Was worthy of my attention.
Sandwiches and ropes were laden into rucksacks.
Like Edmund and Hillary we adventured
Into the dark, damp leaf litter crushed beneath feet
Until we reached the towering canopy- our Everest.
Looking up we saw the planks of base camp, 
left over from previous expeditions. 
Pinched from beneath the nose of my father 
Planting seedlings in the garage.
The top of the oak tree looks over our kingdom
We are better than Belle and Esmeralda and Ariel.
From the summit the green fields go on forever
There is no end to my wonder here.
Returning years later the gnarled tree still stands,
Smaller than memory recalls it from those summers passed.
Rotted wood lies decomposing at the base
Eternity has become finite and my Everest surmountable
		This is based on the poem Personal Helicon by Seamus Heaney. I set my students a homework after we studied the poem. Their task was to write a poem that dealt with how growing up changes your view of the world. I decided to write one too and this is the result.

154,MartinP,Backyard Satsuma,"A distant clamour of voices billows
like a freshly laundered blanket, 
gambolling on the evening breeze like a playful sprite
in jubilation at some nearby sporting victory.

A counterpoint chorus of birdsong gossip – 
‘did you hear? Now he’s singing for someone else’ –
twitters over my flaking backyard wall
offset against a backdrop of light, low cloud that’s lit a dirty blood orange 
by the sun’s reflection as it wanes across the crepuscular azure sky.

I heft the bright, cleaner orange of the satsuma
once, twice, thrice into the air
(and three times, for a second, see two suns setting),
feeling its plump firmness with
a brief squeeze at every catch,
then tear into its gnarly skin with nails
broken, torn and bitten down into saw-teethed blades
(like my own, handy Swiss army knife);
as I struggle with the pithy underbelly 
the skin flays off in annoying little 
scrabbles, tatters, and bits that wriggle
free of my grasp
to land, garish amongst
the greens, whites and yellows of the weeds –
oh, poor, unwanted flowers! – that are forcing their way 
past the monotones of damp asphalt.

I bite through a double segment
and feel a double thrill, the breeze running its fingers across my cheeks
and the liquid squishing between my teeth;
a flinch of bitterness pinches at me,
a recalcitrant piece of pith straying tartly
onto my tongue, then succumbing to the sweet tang 
of citric zest that sprays across my mouth.

And as accompaniment, 
weaving around the other sounds in the background
a soft ‘hush’ sussurates the air as nature prepares its population 
for bed or the nightshift –
-  the sound of distant traffic; wind in the eaves
and rustling through the leaves; power lines rippling
and stripling branches shaking off the worst of the day –
like a soothing hum, a pillow upon which 
the other frequencies can lay their heads.

After reading the prompt, the second thing that came to mind, after puzzle, was an orchestra. The whole concept of all the different notes and sounds from different instruments coming together with precise timing to create a masterpiece strikes me as very similar to a jigsaw puzzle.

156,taylorndncar,Flight of The Great Blue Heron,"
We came to a place at a bend in the river,
where current soothed and churned near a rock-strewn shallow,
and beached our canoes in a late afternoon hour;
to pitch our tents, build fires, and listen to echo.
In fading twilight and into darkness, we drank,
pouring wine into cups and speaking through weak light,
watching the weakening flames of our dying fire,
we told stories until we barely said ""good night"",
with fine dining and drink into dream-worlds we sank
though it was still early, we were forced to retire.
I awoke with a start and stirred under covers,
then felt the call of nature and promptly obeyed;
I slipped on my boots and slipped through the tent-layers,
emerging into a thick fog-shrouded invade.
I stumbled my way to the edge of the water,
relieved my bladder and caught a vague dark shadow;
it was not big nor small among the stones barren,
hunting and pecking in the pebbles, I don't know,
it looked up and saw me, but it didn't matter,
then, I realized it was a Great Blue Heron.
Through shroud of fog, it seemed more phantom than real,
elegant motions in its stalk and graceful neck,
bedecked with plumed-crown and feathers of blue pastel;
its ""sticks for legs and feet"" caused no ripple or fleck.
This avian-fisherman slowly moved downstream,
finishing its hunting at the rocky shallows;
it fluffed its wings in preparation for a flight,
it did not leap, but lifted from earth as follows,
tucking its legs on a down-stroke like a soft dream,
to ride currents of air into last shards of night.
It quickly faded into the thick bank of fog,
an earth-bound cloud following the flow of water,
a liquid ribbon that built driftwood walls of log
as acts of sanity in rage of flood-matter.
Within that span of time, the mist turned ghostly-pale,
and dark silhouettes emerged and grew much more bold;
there was a hint of a sharp ridge and tree-cover,
the air was humid without warmth nor was it cold;
we were in wilderness landscape, a place so frail,
and too soon, our two-day group float trip would be over.  
Formula is based on ""ODE"".  A ten-line stanza with ten syllables per line and a rhyme scheme of ""a-b-a-b-c-d-e-d-c-e"".  An ode is basically a song and should have a ""break for breath"" at the end of the fifth syllable.  This is a ""mock"" ode because each stanza has ten lines, but is made up twelve syllables and is ""awkward"" at the sixth syllable (my rule is to follow the syllabic content of the first line,...it's what comes nature)...!  For the most part, the rhyme scheme is SLANT RHYME, with alliterative and simple rhyme in many lines (called, INTERNAL RHYME).  For example:  The first line of the fourth stanza reads; ""it quickly FADED into the thick bank of FOG...""  The mind catches the rhyme.
Earlier this afternoon, I was shoveling snow out of our driveway; but, four days ago, it was Spring-like weather and I recalled this poetic effort that I lost somewhere in my changes of address.  Back then, the effort was over a photograph I took of a Great Blue Heron taking flight from the Illinois River at Horseshoe Bend (a place that has inspired me on several occasions) and an invite to see the photo or ""get off your ass and go see it for yourself""...!  In this version, I merely invite the reader to ""treat the great outdoors with kindness"".
As writers of thought and observation, it is our duty to go out and experience the world around us, then relate it back to readers, to stir their interest into the nature of our nature...!  Spring and summer is very close,...and snow should not prevent you from seeking nature's beauty...!!!

Earlier this afternoon, I was shoveling snow out of our driveway; but, four days ago, it was Spring-like weather and I recalled this poetic effort that I lost somewhere in my changes of address.  Back then, the effort was over a photograph I took of a Great Blue Heron taking flight from the Illinois River at Horseshoe Bend (a place that has inspired me on several occasions) and an invite to see the photo or ""get off your ass and go see it for yourself""...!  In this version, I merely invite the reader to ""treat the great outdoors with kindness"".

As writers of thought and observation, it is our duty to go out and experience the world around us, then relate it back to readers, to stir their interest into the nature of our nature...!  Spring and summer is very close,...and snow should not prevent you from seeking nature's beauty...!!! ©  on Mar 03 2014 02:37 PM, joe r. taylor   thoughts  • life  • spiritual  • nature     ",Nature
157,Marshall Gass,The Great White,"the chainsaw grin scours through water fountains
in arcs in graceful sweep behind
jaw just open 
the saw swings sharply
cuts deep-mines flesh and bone crunch
gristle blood and bondage of tendons
veins rips and  shreds the fabric
of flesh into bite sized chunks
frenzy of fast food feasts
and then it rolls over gulps and yawns

a low low sweep around victory lap
he circles on a water swing
dorsal up and swaying in a soft sea breeze
he glides between kelp and weed
casually switching a glass eye
at remnants floating by
unconcerned. He was in no hurry.
everyone else was.

ferocious they said. he just grinned
he felt like a gentleman with  a beanie
heading to dinner at the ritz
black-suited and brisk
he strode into checkin 
settled by the window seat
waiting to be served. Heroes first please
( best-mannered)

one icicle sliver of blood
in a whirlpool of swishing frenzy
was enough to unsheath the scabbard sword
unmask a  grin through the mask of his calmness
to get his chainsaw buzzing with drooling teeth and tongue
rasping at the edges like a chariot of horses
ready to go to the finish-meal waiting, Sir!

no hurry chasing morsels floating by

he was happy to make the headlines again,
that's all he wanted. again and again.
the terror was palpable.
from down below, he watched water magnify
their hearts pumping. he grinned.

The lingering Winter has taken its toll
On the withering landscape,
Freezing everything in its path. 
It tries to hang on through the months,
Not relenting it's solstitial season.
But a brave, bold set of flowers,
Emerge from the pile of dead leaves;
A cluster of green bulbs pushes its way through
Announcing the arrival of a long-awaited season.
Spring is just about here; Winter will soon vanish.
The crocuses forged ahead, 
Marbled colors of purple and white 
Crowns the thinly dark green stems.
Small, but majestic blossoms,
Begin to open, to reveal,
Sweet, yellow-orange nectar
Inviting honey bees to savor its sweet perfume.
Although these humbled blossoms of velvety purple,
May not be as elegant as the sweet red rose, 
Or as tall as the colossal sunflower of gold, 
Or have the sweet, succulent aroma 
Of the lavender flowers of the lilac bush,
The crocuses have a very important role:
Announcing the arrival of Mother Nature
As she paints the cruel, ugly colored landscape,
Into a myriad of colors; bright and brilliant.
Crocuses - the humbled;
Bold,  and beautiful,
The first sign of Spring.
For the contest: A to Z Flowers: Letter C by Intricate Wordsmith. 
I chose the crocuses - not only because I had this amazing photo to go with it - but I felt that they were the ""forgotten"" flower - they're not as popular as the others, but they do play an important role every Spring...the true symbol of Spring....Hope you enjoy!

That the Moon reflects a part of our soul.
Nature told me the rivers are entwined with our blood, 
And one day our bodies will form part of the mud.
Nature taught me that all life is art,
And the sun embodies the passions of our hearts.
Nature told me the stars guide and protect our dreams,
And our lives are part of a wider scheme. ",Love
176,WandaLeaBrayton,Just Before Autumn (Neruda and more),"
After the fog lifted, sunlight dappled through an ancient curtain, 
a slow revelation, yet only silence remained. 
I found repose by the north side of the house 
where only moss felt safe enough to grow; deep, lush, damp, 
a thickened brush of emerald heavy near four symmetrical cherry trees, 
long before Pablo found me (or I found him), 
I knew the taste and texture of melancholy,
the feeling of an ocean surging inside the caverns of my heart.
On the south side, two imposing pear trees stood;
hornets would gather there, greedily gathering fallen fruit's waste, 
waiting to insert their barbed stingers into the tender foot of a child
who would not weep, who would only mourn
their sudden, terrible demise.

The Leaving
By Brigit Pegeen Kelly

	My father said I could not do it,
	but all night I picked the peaches.
	The orchard was still, the canals ran steadily.
	I was a girl then, my chest its own walled garden.
	How many ladders to gather an orchard?
	I had only one and a long patience with lit hands
	and the looking of the stars which moved right through me
	the way the water moved through the canals with a voice
	that seemed to speak of this moonless gathering
	and those who had gathered before me.
	I put the peaches in the pond’s cold water,
	all night up the ladder and down, all night my hands
	twisting fruit as if I were entering a thousand doors,
	all night my back a straight road to the sky.
	And then out of its own goodness, out
	of the far fields of the stars, the morning came,
	and inside me was the stillness a bell possesses
	just after it has been rung, before the metal
	begins to long again for the clapper’s stroke.
	The light came over the orchard.
	The canals were silver and then were not,
	and the pond was—I could see as I laid
	the last peach in the water—full of fish and eyes.

	in the fingers of the fishermen that found her
	One man swore that he saw a tiny fish between her lungs
	breathing heavily beneath the weight of her ribs
	When I saw the story on the news
	I thought of you and how you would yelp when I
	saw you naked, how you hid your pale body beneath the sheets
	How it was always a joy to catch a glimpse
	of your collarbones, porcelain-white,
	as your sweater fluttered to the ground
	The therapist says it’s a defense mechanism,
	a form of resistance to weakness,
	but now I wonder
	if maybe you had something hidden
	growing in your ribs too

182,poetrandy,Grandpa Joe Had a Fine Stetson Fedora,"Grandpa Joe had a fine Stetson fedora, high button boots, farmer's disheveled faded blue coveralls, a flap for his hammer, with pencil, notepad, matches, change purse, other's business cards, comb for his grey, thin hair, eyeglasses, a compass.
Grandpa Joe’s place was reached by a walk or ride down a long straight 150 foot dirt driveway.  The four acre place on rich, fruitful land, had a plow horse, a milk cow or two, kept in a gigantic old tar papered wooden barn.  His favorite possession was a golden Palomino filly ""Goldie,"" the mother a pure bred, chestnut Arab.
Grandpa Joe was tall, stooped, strong, stocky, sociable, quiet, helpful. His wide, toothy grin and optimistic outlook, amazed me.  He discussed politics and the newspaper's editorial, when anyone would listen, with the top of an old nail barrel for a chair.  He was thrifty, saved every paper, in pile upon pile in the barn, ever since the WWII paper drives and shortages, kept an extensive expense journal. 
Grandpa Joe’s front two acres held a clabbered white ranch style house, a little dirty yellow Studebaker coupe, old beat up horse drawn wagon, rough built wooden wash room, two seat outhouse.  He  always said he would never fly in those awful, noisy airborne contraptions. He had sidelines, in earlier times:  a dairy herd, rabbits, donkeys, soft and furry beagle puppies, fearsome multicolored greyhounds. 
He was an inventor, once raised cattle, rigged up a lever action slaughter machine, fed his chickens with a gravity flow, feed and water system, built a walk-in incubator, sold many chicks, every water trough on the farm had a homemade flapper valve. 
Grandpa Joe cared for a few older ladies, a widower for over forty years.  He grew iris, sweet peas, hyacinth, jasmine, roses, gladiolas, most of the year, fine weather in southern California, prettiest for his lady friends.  He had a magical multi-row, half acre vegetable garden, with enough fresh fruit and green veggies for our family of five. 
Grandpa Joe was tough, timid, tireless.  He read like a torrid madman, a perpetual radio listener, could never watch TV (we never knew if he could even see it.)  In younger days a carpenter, contractor, carver, cabinet maker, a craftsman. He was caretaker for his offspring. This contest entry is a narrative, in what I would call a prose poetry form.It was inspired by my memories of my dear grandfather Joe. Grandpa Joe had a fine Stetson fedora, high button boots, farmer's disheveled faded blue

184,CarolDesjarlais,Horse Man - Silver,"once there was a horseman, with a quarter horse knitted to his back, 
grey Stetson, tilted back so sunshine bristled on his brow
smoke escaping from his nose
wild horses galloping out of his mouth

a bit of bellicose brag reined in for his woman
who parked her pointer finger, sideways
above her eagle eyes to search his horizon

but, oh, in the back rooms of the wheat elevator
chaff sidestepping on stray sunbeams
running a ragged race to tell the tallest story
of finest thoroughbred thoughts, running
against the next best for their trophy

none of them had been in a saddle for years
but their gnarled stories recalled the pull
of a pioneer wagon behind plow horses
and a white sail across the prairies,
over the rocky passes, when they were yearlings
to married life and a mention of free land

it was never free grandfather
you broke your back to it, and her,
with her wilds dreams of a hoe and hearth
and baking bread in a real oven, raising children
under a well-shingled roof, and forcing a garden
out of hard earth while the mares foaled
and she did, to add weight to this new place

half-broke geldings scuffed fresh riders
off in the branches of the poplar boundary
of the farm-turned-ranch you two carved
out in the country you landed boots first in
where the muck of milk cows waited
on promised hay and a gentle hand
while you rode off into dust to dust

I hold it, here, the deed of fine land
ownership of a generation of foals,
pictures of a young man and a woman
astride similar star-faced, half-starved mounts
frozen and leaning against a rotted corral
waiting for the click of tongue to roof of mouth
to race back with its memories

I hold the sweater to my face and feel the prickly heat
of stubble that has been chewed down by the equine teeth
of packing a heart into hard trails made by man and horse
until I rock in the saddle hanging on to your back
like a princess being saved by a knight of necessity

your voice sings, “Oh, Give Me A Home”, and the hill hears it
memorizes the meanings of a man made from sway-back
stories of riding a rough range to make a tall tale
for a green-broke granddaughter riding ",Love

It was a scorching humid summer afternoon


she needed relief and she needed it soon


took the water hose and turned it on high


pointed the nozzle toward the sky


bent over the arching fountain and took a sip


dousing her face and not just her lips


it felt so good, this wonderful wetness


she hosed down herself and left her breathless


laid upon the grass in wet shorts and top


glad for a moment when she could stop


not noticing every eye was locked on her


until in her ear she heard a purr


so she turned on her tummy and looked up in his eyes


temperature rose more as she began to sigh


in the palms of his hands he gently took her face


kissed this hot woman and took her in his embrace


before it was over and before it was done


they had so much fun just playing in the sun.

In the still of the night you come to me
I sense your shape in the pale moonlight
I listen for you each chiming hour
And the far off surge of the sea

Lulled by the curve of the sickled moon",Love
191,sanamacha,angel,"every shout  a drop of blood
squirting from the twisted veins
the destiny’s road opens
to another quite unknown corner

every shout stifled by heartbeat 
of silence holds a desire to cut 
the uneaten loaf of heart

their ears are deaf 
a head of stone
a body of wood 
fingers of clay that
have forgotten how to clasp a flower 
or rise a hand in protest

music that has become air
settles down at the navel of midnight 
it’s an angel singing
under the leihao tree to sleeping hours
to closed windows and doors
only the leaves and grasses of 
the earth responds

with daybreak the lips the nose
the hands the limbs the eyes
awakened 
the air lost its music
the angel is only a love disowned
by both the lover and the beloved",Love

He holds out his hands toward her


his long fingers wiggle for her to come 


maybe not the best looking by far


but better looking than some.


	 

He draws her tight to his six-pack abs


letting her meld against his frame


tilts that black stetson down


and softly whispers her name.


	 

He splays his hands with fingers spread


across her soft and gentle back


rubbing up and down her spine


causing shivers of which was no lack.


	 

The big buckle riding on his belt


was soon dispatched and cast aside


she tried to hesitantly move away


but he crossed the room in a single stride.


	 

When the first kiss came hungrily to her lips


passionate fireworks did explode


gathering her up in his arms


and to the bed with her he strode.


	 

The cowboy knew how to handle


horses and women gently too


he left her craving more


when that rodeo was through.

For APTP VII Round Four
PROMPT: The above photo is the prompt for this round. Photo is of a man underwater looking at his watch.
MISSION STATEMENT: As the photo appears to be surreal and enigmatic, I decided to rely on what it made me feel instinctively. The coloring, the serenity of the surrounding, made me think of moments after a relationship ended, where one has to draw back and submerge themselves into a calm and quiet place, somewhere to ponder and release the past. I thought of those times when this type of loneliness made even a rebound relationship seem desirable and necessary, that any kind of touch, even upside down, is better than none at all. Hence the imagery of how even though a star may have already died thousands of years ago, somewhere in space, its last rays of light is still touching and warming something cold.
On a personal level, music has always played a huge part in the healing process for me in such situations, and there is no other artist I crave to listen to more than Tori Amos, which is why a few of her lyrics are laced within this piece, specifically 'Cooling', and 'Upside Down' on her B-sides. Her music and voice tend to remind of being underwater, where in a world of hazy blue, you can finally hear your own voice for the first time.

	NOTE: Guanyin Pusa is the Chinese goddess of compassion, a deity that refuses to rise to heaven as long as there is a single soul left suffering in the world. She is often depicted holding a porcelain bottle of liquid mercy. It is said that when one of her worshippers dies, she will place their souls in the heart of a lotus before sending them onto Nirvana.

And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour. 

A Robin Red breast in a Cage
Puts all Heaven in a Rage.
A dove house fill'd with doves & Pigeons
Shudders Hell thro' all its regions.
A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate
Predicts the ruin of the State.
A Horse misus'd upon the Road
Calls to Heaven for Human blood.
Each outcry of the hunted Hare
A fibre from the Brain does tear.
A Skylark wounded in the wing,
A Cherubim does cease to sing.
The Game Cock clipp'd and arm'd for fight
Does the Rising Sun affright.
Every Wolf's & Lion's howl
Raises from Hell a Human Soul.
The wild deer, wand'ring here & there,
Keeps the Human Soul from Care.
The Lamb misus'd breeds public strife
And yet forgives the Butcher's Knife.
The Bat that flits at close of Eve
Has left the Brain that won't believe.
The Owl that calls upon the Night
Speaks the Unbeliever's fright.
He who shall hurt the little Wren
Shall never be belov'd by Men.
He who the Ox to wrath has mov'd
Shall never be by Woman lov'd.
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly
Shall feel the Spider's enmity.
He who torments the Chafer's sprite
Weaves a Bower in endless Night.
The Catterpillar on the Leaf
Repeats to thee thy Mother's grief.
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly,
For the Last Judgement draweth nigh.
He who shall train the Horse to War
Shall never pass the Polar Bar.
The Beggar's Dog & Widow's Cat,
Feed them & thou wilt grow fat.
The Gnat that sings his Summer's song
Poison gets from Slander's tongue.
The poison of the Snake & Newt
Is the sweat of Envy's Foot.
The poison of the Honey Bee
Is the Artist's Jealousy.
The Prince's Robes & Beggars' Rags
Are Toadstools on the Miser's Bags.
A truth that's told with bad intent
Beats all the Lies you can invent.
It is right it should be so;
Man was made for Joy & Woe;
And when this we rightly know
Thro' the World we safely go.
Joy & Woe are woven fine,
A Clothing for the Soul divine;
Under every grief & pine
Runs a joy with silken twine.
The Babe is more than swadling Bands;
Throughout all these Human Lands
Tools were made, & born were hands,
Every Farmer Understands.
Every Tear from Every Eye
Becomes a Babe in Eternity.
This is caught by Females bright
And return'd to its own delight.
The Bleat, the Bark, Bellow & Roar
Are Waves that Beat on Heaven's Shore.
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath
Writes Revenge in realms of death.
The Beggar's Rags, fluttering in Air,
Does to Rags the Heavens tear.
The Soldier arm'd with Sword & Gun,
Palsied strikes the Summer's Sun.
The poor Man's Farthing is worth more
Than all the Gold on Afric's Shore.
One Mite wrung from the Labrer's hands
Shall buy & sell the Miser's lands:
Or, if protected from on high,
Does that whole Nation sell & buy.
He who mocks the Infant's Faith
Shall be mock'd in Age & Death.
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt
The rotting Grave shall ne'er get out.
He who respects the Infant's faith
Triumph's over Hell & Death.
The Child's Toys & the Old Man's Reasons
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons.
The Questioner, who sits so sly,
Shall never know how to Reply.
He who replies to words of Doubt
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out.
The Strongest Poison ever known
Came from Caesar's Laurel Crown.
Nought can deform the Human Race
Like the Armour's iron brace.
When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow.
A Riddle or the Cricket's Cry
Is to Doubt a fit Reply.
The Emmet's Inch & Eagle's Mile
Make Lame Philosophy to smile.
He who Doubts from what he sees
Will ne'er believe, do what you Please.
If the Sun & Moon should doubt
They'd immediately Go out.
To be in a Passion you Good may do,
But no Good if a Passion is in you.
The Whore & Gambler, by the State
Licenc'd, build that Nation's Fate.
The Harlot's cry from Street to Street
Shall weave Old England's winding Sheet.
The Winner's Shout, the Loser's Curse,
Dance before dead England's Hearse.

Some to Misery are Born.

	Bay City. It's a nice little town, a prosperous little town;
	Sea breezes off the ocean just about mask the stink of corruption.
	Some say the sewage system is overloaded with half digested hot dogs;
	Jesus, it's California and money talks. I needed a drink bad.
	I walked into a bar just off Arguello Boulevard. Maybe about five p.m.
	I told the bartender to give me a shot of his best rye and leave the bottle.
	He laughed in my face as he poured it but I'm a hopeful kind of guy.
	I sat on a stool at the bar and looked around: it was a dump.
	It was as hot as Hell outside and so was I, hot and horny for a dame.
	A glazed-over eyed old alkie slumped on a chair in a corner;
	There were a couple of broads sat at the bar and I toasted them.
	One was all woman, my kind of woman, young but old enough;
	Blonde hair down to her shoulders, eyes like ponds of icewater,
	Legs going right up to her armpits, enough to tempt a saint,
	Her mouth a luscious gash, lips like two blood-red frankfurters,
	The kind of mouth inviting you to lick her molars clean.
	She was the sort of woman who could make any regular guy, even me,
	Roll over on his back, all four paws in the air, begging for it.
	I knew it and she knew it. She was a beautiful piece of work.
	The other woman was a dog. They were Beauty and the Beast.
	You've got to have some beasts in this life, that's how it goes, I guess.
	She was big, maybe not as big as a beer truck, but not far off.
	She was as cute as a cracked washtub and her face was a bucket of lard.
	Her chin had a dimple you could hide a marble in and not touch the sides.
	I knew the score, I'd been there before: they came as a pair.
	One was a dream, the other was a nightmare,
	Great in the sack, but only if you enjoy grunting.
	What the Hell, I told the barkeep to send them over some drinks.
	The blonde took a Bacardi and gave me the glad eye
	And the big one ordered a quart of beer, like she was on a diet.
	They declined my sophisticated small talk and told me the deal:
	Two C notes for the blonde solo, fifty percent off for the duo.
	Back at my hotel on Central Avenue, I found out it was a good price:
	The dream girl had a body to die for but showed as much enthusiasm
	As a turkey shows for Thanksgiving, which is Goddam' close to zero.
	But the Beast sucked like a Hoover (and J.Edgar I don't mean)
	And rode me like the Lone Ranger galloping over the prairie,
	Taking me all the way down the long winding trail home.
	She had an ass like a hippo and she wobbled like giant jello.
	Motto: when you die, it's the big sleep; so, never say no to a woman.
	 
	This is the 210st in my ""Memories"" series. It is DIFFERENT from my other poems in so far as it is written in the style of Raymond Chandler.
	I'm now getting into parody, so #211 is in the style of J.M. Synge: http://allpoetry.com/poem/10807125 and, sure, but it will destroy you utterly.

208,Dlmchale,On Awakening a Memory,"
I have walked a thousand country miles -
watched the falcons pirouette in the summer sky;
lunched upon bitter green apples and fermented mangoes
and napped beneath the hot luminous clock;
quenched my thirst with melodious silver spring water 
and skipped stones across frozen lakes.
I’ve immortalized poets against the echoing granite walls of time.
In bare feet I danced in verdant green meadows
that carpet a bottomless valley; 
traced my fingertips along the gnarled grooves
of a dying oak and bid it farewell.
I have bathed in babbling brooks that giggled at 
my nakedness and dried myself in the wispy autumn winds.
Upon mountaintops, I have squeezed sunsets between
my forefinger and thumb and slowly opened them again to
the shimmering glow of a new moon.
I have slept beneath a canopy of universes and composed 
my dreams against shimmering stars;
built wet sandcastles fit for kings on foreign shores
and fed them to the ravenous surf.
Beneath cascading waterfalls were written tumbling
verse, while angelfish nibbled at my dropped metaphors.
In the Mascarene Islands, I flew kites built from 
forest reeds and raffia palms until they were swallowed
by drifting winter clouds.
The return to a new day awaits me, and a thousand more
miles beneath my feet before this life is drawn complete.
Awakening a memory, I close my eyes 
and the colors of life’s possibilities explode beneath my lids.

sensing her non-countryside ways,
a towny, others'd say. Just doing
a bit, he says, got hay bales to

stack, tidy and lay. Can I help?
she says, I’ve nothing much to do?
If you like, he says, and walks
along to the barn and she follows,

swaying her hips, holding her
head to one side. He shows her
the hay bales, where they need
to be and how to stack. It smells

in here, she says, heat of hay,
he says, gets stuffy. She runs a hand
over the nearest bales. Soft enough,
she says, looking at him, her eyes

focusing, sniffing the air. Soft enough
for what? He says. To lay on, cuddle
on, she say softly. Best not, he says,
others may come. Not up there, she

says, pointing to a higher place above
their heads, there we'd not been seen.
Best not, he says, they want me for
work not to laze or shirk. She pouts

her lips, walks about the barn, touching
with her fingers, running palms over
the bales. Just a little while, she says,
unbuttoning her blouse, needn't be long,

fingers slowly working the buttons.
There's mice and rats about, he says,
could be anywhere in here. She pauses,
her fingers still, her eyes enlarging.

Here? she asks. He nods, seen them
about, a few hours ago. She buttons
up her blouse, gazing around. Shame,
she says, wanted to, you know, here

in the quiet, us alone. He stands and
gazes, takes in her slim frame, her eyes,
her hands holding each other and
squeezing. Another time maybe, she

says, some other place, somewhere
that's quiet, where we'd not be disturbed.
He nods, viewing her small breasts
tidied away, at least for the day, like

small babes put to bed, and tucked
up safe and sound. She kisses his cheek,
touches his arm, see you, she says softly,
see you around, and she walks way,

212,louis Keys,I drove a thousand miles in my sleep to dream of this,"I watched them as if they were an old movie--
their black and white movements--
dancing like angels, fingers interlocking
in a tangle of expressive serenity.
Their silence echoed through the sky
like kisses blown through rings of smoke.

I watched their eyes encounter
and gravitate towards one another--
past the drifting air particles
to the patterns in skin.
I watched his pupils pounce
upon the freckle pressed to her nose--
I watched her eyes dip into his collarbone,  
inhabiting every pore.

I could feel them breathe
as they embraced each other--
with every inhalation their bodies shuddered--
my body shook.

They were the epicenter 
of an earthquake--

a forsaken love
that I took as pure bliss--
for time could not unbind these two
as they kissed.Prompt line was taken from this poem: http://allpoetry.com/poem/8763507-Sweet_Amnesia-by-Dalaney-noguest",Love

219,shepherds call,Sweet Scents,"
	In the early morning
	as the darkness begins to turn to light
	she awakens to the smell of coffee brewing.
	She turns-
	searching for her love-
	sits slowly on the side of the bed and
	arises to wash her face.
	She decides to shower-
	                Dresses-
	combs her hair and applies makeup.
	He had arisen hours before-
	dressing casually for his love-
	preparing for the day they shall spend
	                  together.
	She walks slowly to the kitchen-
	                  sees him standing by the window
	tenderly she wraps her arms around him-
	smells the scent of sweet cologne.
	He turns-
	                affectionately hugs her-
	smells the scent of lavender in her hair.
	Together they choose the day’s events
	together they shall smell the scents of the day-
	                  the flowers that bloom along the highways-
	                  the aromas of food and drink from kitchens unknown-
	                the titillating and curious scents of the city. 
	Days light begins to slowly turn into twilight-
	the day’s events now become memories.
	Together they shall enjoy the evening-
	sitting side by side-
	                children no longer at home-
	choosing to do something or-
	                    choosing to do nothing.
	Night now has arrived 
	together they shall kneel to pray-
	              to offer praises-
	              to offer thanks-
	              to pray for family-
	                            for friends.
	Suddenly a sweet aroma enters-
	              the smell of myrrh, honeysuckle and lavender, of sweet perfumes.
	The scent becomes stronger-
	the room begins to cool-
	              a haze enters.
	For a moment they wonder-
	              until---------
	they realize-
	              the Holy Spirit has entered in
	                              and-
	the smell of sweet aroma that now fills the air
	                              is because-
	they, together, have entered into worship.
	God has honored them because they have honored Him  -
	              never forgetting to give Him glory-
	              never forgetting that it is He that   joined them together.
	In worship-
	Can you not smell the sweet scents of our Lord?
	               
	The sermon was about trust in the Lord- How Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice trusting that God would provide an alternative.  Pastor further explained that a sacrifice was offered in worship. That one thought lingered as I began to wonder about sacrifice.
	In the early morning

	              to offer thanks-
	              to pray for family-
	                            for friends.
	Suddenly a sweet aroma enters-
	              the smell of myrrh, honeysuckle and lavender, of sweet perfumes.
	The scent becomes stronger-
	the room begins to cool-
	              a haze enters.
	For a moment they wonder-
	              until---------
	they realize-
	              the Holy Spirit has entered in
	                              and-
	the smell of sweet aroma that now fills the air
	                              is because-
	they, together, have entered into worship.
	God has honored them because they have honored Him  -
	              never forgetting to give Him glory-
	              never forgetting that it is He that   joined them together.
	In worship-
	Can you not smell the sweet scents of our Lord?
	               
	The sermon was about trust in the Lord- How Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice trusting that God would provide an alternative.  Pastor further explained that a sacrifice was offered in worship. That one thought lingered as I began to wonder about sacrifice. ©  on Jun 18 2012 07:55 PM, Naomi Chavez   spiritual  • love  • life  • hope    ",Love

She watched as he struggled


muscles pulling sails in a tug of war

only made her want him more.


	 

When he finally came to shore

she threw her arms around him


before soundly kissing him on the lips.

	Technically 'Tang Jie' means 'older sugar sister' and 'Tang Mei' is 'younger sugar sister'.
	This is for my Tang Jie Elin and my Tang Mei Teresa. This is in tribute to the first and only time we were able to meet as young adult women and hung out in Tijuana for a day, trading family secrets and getting drunk, lol.
	As always, I weep not because of the memories, but the fact that we can't make anymore. Yet I know our love will allow us to recognize each other on that bridge.

Her toe nails are painted in bright red, her petit feet are as soft as the hair 
Of a new born cat.
Her legs are long, solid and they move like they have a mind of their own. When you hear her high heels tapping across some marble floor your heart will snap in two. Her legs are as beautiful and as magnificent as the pillars of
 Ancient Rome.
Her hips swing like a diamond-incrusted chandelier. The black dress she wears covers her bum like the shroud that covered
 Jesus.
She smells like the fields of Provence, lavender, flowers and sunshine. Her breasts are firm, they slowly move up and down, as the woman takes slow, sexual 
Gulps of night
 Air.
Her mouth is like that of a Russian socialite from the 19th century, 
her magical eyes reminded one of those of Cleopatra, and
 her long brown hair dances in the slow breeze
 Like a peacocks feather being used as a fan 
by a French princess.

The Road Between Us
The road between us stretched into long silences
	neither of us could seem to absorb,
	so you went east while I flew west,
	searching for dreams we didn't share.
	We were simply wildflowers stretching furiously,
	never knowing how to reach for light.
Pale Moon in Deep Sky
It reeks of maudlin moods
and forgotten essences of summer skies,
this harbinger of doom and unrelenting desire.
Her envy is a translucent blanket grown heavy
on nights when slumber is restless, bereft of dreams.
Her patina and form may shift 
in uncomfortable awareness of this bitter shroud of night, 
yet she will not remain quiet or still.
She whirls her wild shimmer across subdued faces of shadows,
insisting on being the center of sepia light, 
of our undrenched focus.
She will not release our cautious gaze 
toward shuddering stars, those gauzy pinpricks of grandeur
become faded by their inevitable demise.
When she waxes, she rules this broad canvas of darkness;
when she wanes, her memory will not forgive her mortal mist. 
The Division Bells
Inspired by David Gilmour and Pink Floyd
Bells peeled back the face of night;
a wretched wrenching of starlit moans
revealed this pale sun to unbelieving eyes.
Black wings fluttered beneath bare branches
as leaves scuttled into lanes.
Winter’s wrath cannot be hidden 
under snow’s satin assurances.
Beneath
In the autumn of my existence,
I waited, watching as colors streamed silently,
far from an elusive horizon,
the urgent edges of a madding crowd.
In the winter of my darkest woe,
I became immobilized by fire's deep, siren voice
as a lone, fetal sculpture burrowed instinctively.
In the spring of my thawing,
a trickle led towards an infinite ocean,
quietly spilling its song.
In the summer of my surrender,
I would lie naked under stars and dream
of mere roses that never bloomed,
ancient, unborn sorrows rising, instead, 
from fallow soil.

on nights when slumber is restless, bereft of dreams.

	 

Her patina and form may shift 

in uncomfortable awareness of this bitter shroud of night, 

yet she will not remain quiet or still.

	 

She whirls her wild shimmer across subdued faces of shadows,

insisting on being the center of sepia light, 

of our undrenched focus.

	 

She will not release our cautious gaze 

toward shuddering stars, those gauzy pinpricks of grandeur

become faded by their inevitable demise.

	 

When she waxes, she rules this broad canvas of darkness;

when she wanes, her memory will not forgive her mortal mist. 

	 

	 

The Division Bells

Inspired by David Gilmour and Pink Floyd

	 

Bells peeled back the face of night;

a wretched wrenching of starlit moans

revealed this pale sun to unbelieving eyes.

Black wings fluttered beneath bare branches

as leaves scuttled into lanes.

Winter’s wrath cannot be hidden 

under snow’s satin assurances.

	 

	 

Beneath

	 

In the autumn of my existence,

I waited, watching as colors streamed silently,

far from an elusive horizon,

the urgent edges of a madding crowd.

	 

In the winter of my darkest woe,

I became immobilized by fire's deep, siren voice

as a lone, fetal sculpture burrowed instinctively.

	 

In the spring of my thawing,

a trickle led towards an infinite ocean,

quietly spilling its song.

	 

In the summer of my surrender,

I would lie naked under stars and dream

of mere roses that never bloomed,

ancient, unborn sorrows rising, instead, 

from fallow soil.

	So tiny she was lying in her bed,
	bandages and tubing ran about her head
	Nurses and Dr.'s bringing help in every way,
	then a nurse heard her say-
	Jesus came this morning and held my hands,
	he told me he would find a way.

	The nurse turned slowly and watched 
	as she continued that day,
	The nurse then asked the little girl
	to tell her all about his face.

	There was a golden light about him
	and eyes of chestnut brown,
	His hands were ever so warm
	and he wore a snow white gown.
	As he spoke to me it sounded different
	like when listening under water so blue
	that's when it was like something moved.

	The Dr came in that morning
	she replied you sure it wasn't him?
	No it wasn't the little girl replied
	there are shoes on him.
	This man had on sandals
	held  together with a type of twine,
	and they made not a sound as he walked by.

	Then the nurse left the room
	but before she sprinkled powder about,
	and carefully made sure she didn't leave
	any prints on the way out.
	The day went on without any visitor
	not one she could see
	and in the afternoon she reentered
	shocked at what she did see.

	There were footprints  about the bed
	a mans for sure
	and she asked  the little girl
	and she shook her head ""yes for sure"".
	He told me I didn't have to worry
	and the Dr. will let me go home,
	but the nurse didn't believe her
	for her illness was an incurable one .

	As the Dr. came in and one look
	he couldn't believe his eyes,
	he asked the nurse what was going on
	and began to check eyes with a light.
	The abrasions are gone and the bruising healed
	he couldn't believe his eyes,
	and ordered  test for it couldn't be real
	a miracle he denied.
	And the Dr. just laughed as he walked away.
	The little  girl giggled  and whispered for the nurse to hear
	its the non believers who  death they fear.
	For  I have known all along Jesus was by my side
	and could  lift  me from this illness
	only the father could deny  .

His strong hands grasp her flesh causing gentle gasp to spill from her lips.
Suds slide down his back as her fingertips release water to fall upon it.

The kids say daddy, daddy and you suggest we play

After a few hours we come home to an empty house
So we raid the refrigerator and make some supper
 
Later, the kids start bathing, and getting ready for bed
I look at the empty driveway, and glance at the phone
It rings; you’re finally done shopping, and coming home
Wondering, what you bought as you say “I got a surprise”
 
I hang up the phone eager to see what you bought
The kids in bed for the night, upstairs I head. I can’t wait
You come in with your hands full and a grin on your face
Lying nude on the bed waiting for the bathroom door to open
 
From behind the door I see a nylon foot and a little leg
You slowly show yourself inch by inch, come on I plead
White satin lingerie trimmed in red the lady is wearing
Jasmine is wafting up my nose; she lays down beside me
 
She says” I was looking for a nude man in my bed”
Teasing me, her tongue slowly moving across her lips
I said “ I am the nude man in your bed. will I do”
She laughed out loud “Yes, you’re the man I want “

and it's out of place in this grimy city.
fingers gripping back pockets, don't get lost.
expected to slip between the cracks
seperating sidewalk pavement, filled with
bubble gum and dirt.
the courtesy coins in his instrument's leather case
spill out and are apt to meet with her pink spit.
and now you can't pick those pennies up off the cement
rolling, spinning, twirling, out of grasp
of that bubble
gum and i feel it hit my shoe
as i walk away from him, the one whose song
is jazz, quarter that shimmers as it settles.
and i turn, catch his eye, the one on the corner
rhapsody of blue backtracks,
and fingers entwine, causing the songs
to blend.  ",Love

Her hands were nothing glamorous, 
as far as she was concerned - 
merely tools meant for capturing 
fragrant petals before they fell, 
necessary for gathering food 
(one needs sustenance, after all), 
deft at mending torn silk with such empathy, 
its wounds could not be seen. 
In the beginning, she refused his fervent pursuit, 
having no penchant for unwanted attentions. 
Her palette was full and tremulous. 
Still, there was something about crisp vision 
in a man so intrigued by her scent, 
wound within her long tendrils - 
her strands trailed with rapture 
beyond nightfall's diminishing reach.
From the east, 
he whispered her name again in his dreams. 
From the west, 
she ﬁnally answered, drenched in jasmine. 
Their hands splayed wild breadths 
of each other's vast canvases, 
swelling into history's torrid embrace - 
even now, they swim rebelliously 
beneath delicate tides like these, 
stirred slowly by moon's silvery glow, 
pulsating rhythms echoing their remembered skin.

this morning
your voice needed crutches
and i set mine to a torch
my mouth is an over packed suitcase
full of 'no please' and 'don't you see'
i can only carry 50 kilos away
110 pounds of leftovers
60 short of your head and shoulders
but i wonder
how else can i suffocate
a moment as precious
as this
i am not good at rage
i don't blow
only peel
like the best german potato
in a french onion soup
and though i have lost both 40 days
plus keys to the storage unit
and though you said
with your sesame mouth
that you would
if i would
(but you never will)
tonight remains
silent
as blind men
searching a starry night
my plight
is even when alone
i still see you under the covers
it is my fate
to find christ in the cornflakes
and whisper to the spoon
how i will change the world
twelve people at a time
they will be my
new testament men
and smash themselves
into the skin of history
stain it like a new woman
the roads of her eyes will shine
like the coins of damascus
and she will smile
because she swallowed
all your corinthians
and bellowed in thessalonians
her holy spit epistles
that yet another cross
has sprung upside down
for you
and in humid words
spelled out in dogwood letters
i will carve
my initials within the cells
leave footprints
along your spine
slice into the belly
until i am buried
within the red jelly
and cook
like rare wine
within the
blood stream
it will gouge along the bones
and etch into the nether parts
in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
in a song of shrouds
and those seconds
when i confess

fucking
crazy

of our fragmented destinies
where i will wait

before giving birth
back to myself
PROMPT: The quote stems from Franz Kafka. ""In this love you are like a knife, with which I explore myself."" This week, Kara has chosen that we ruminate on this idea and view love from this unique perspective.
MISSION STATEMENT: The themes I wanted to explore after pondering on the Kafka quote were ones of how we are prone to literally want to sacrifice all for love. I borrowed heavily from the Christian crucifixion archetype as I believe it was an expression of 'ultimate love' as the Book of John states: 'For God so LOVED the world, He gave his only begotten son'. Yet in that rush and desire to give all, we sometimes end up giving too much, and that is where the knife enters the picture...how we cut ourselves up to please the ones we love, bleeding profusely in all aspects because we feel that is the only way to make them happy. We become so immersed in their needs that we lose ourselves and can't remember where they end and we begin.
	Such a love as that can over time prove toxic, and so the ending of this piece continues with the crucifixion aftermath, i.e., the resurrection of ourselves once we realize how crazy we've let this become. We must gather back our pieces and somehow re-glue them back to what we once were and hopefully remember the next time we fall for someone to always retain enough of ourselves to love both the other and us equally. As they so often say, one plus one equals two and does not stay just one. I personally believe one should never martyr themselves for the sake of love as there must always be an exchange to keep the balance. And what is balance but harmony in its most perfect form?
NOTE: The imagery of taking away 50 kilos (110 pounds) was inspired by a holocaust documentary I recently watched where Polish Jews were instructed that they could only carry 50 kilos with them to the ghettos. I thought how hard and achingly poignant that must have been. To reduce a whole life to a suitcase weighing only that little. Yet sometimes we leave with much less than that in certain broken relationships.

Your love was like a knife to my heart. It was as sudden as the flowers blooming in spring, As sharp and vivid as the color of the new leaves. Making my heart skip several beats. We were like two teenagers falling in love in the summer heat. Getting drunk off cheap wine, Falling deep. Your eyes lit up like fireflies in a June night. Then our summer love slipped into fall. All the signs were there that the flowers were dying. Although it happened slow, It died like a leaf drifting down low. Once it died there was no more denying. The sheets on my bed were as cold as the snow. Even though my eyes were dry, My life was as barren and gray as a winter day.

Honey wanted to look nice for the gentleman who would be coming for dinner. She soaked in a hot bubble bath luxuriating in her spa like tub for an hour or so. After drying, putting on her white robe, she styled her long auburn hair to complement her pretty face, applied her makeup and her red lipstick, then dressed in a black slim fitting dress, her tinted hose and her favorite black high heels. She looked like a model.


 



She started to prepare dinner by using fresh herbs, and dandelions to the main course of veal marsala,  pumpkin soup, waldorf salad,  with chocolate parfeit for dessert.



 


The bell rang, it was him and she let him in; a little kiss, a martini, the main course and a dessert, funny the chocolate parfeit wasn't touched because they decided to read novels instead.

	The shower of details, I could

	I see them getting ready to drum fingers

	as they smile, smile and nod.

285,ukombozi,Night in Midwinter," I remember the long
dark night, cavernous,
no thoughts of the
yellowed sun, the 
snow clad ground
made blue by the mirror
of the black velvet sky,
outside the frosted
window of your little
apartment in that
old northern city.

I remember our lanky limbs
forming  a Celtic knot
in the small hours, quiet
yawns and dreamy
sighs, the language 
of our contentment,
unbroken despite
the whirring sirens
and howling dogs
down below. 

I remember the specter
of morning looming
harsh and tight above",Love
286,Deacon Kane,Comfort,"The early signs of passing times
are the way these things must go,
the lusting lovers, the smiling priests,
the virgin nuns, amidst the catcalls
and the echoes of this city the
years have turned like cartwheels
on the green, grey, ivory of our parks,
and somewhere still a little boy runs out, 
a little lost, a little proud unknowing
of the sights and sounds of women,
the scent of chamomile, the way these wicked
hounds must howl out at the moon,
the way every woman becomes a mother,
the way every man who loves her rests",Love
287,myriad-dark,Ode to the Predator Heart ,"Thoughts coursing,  vernal fluxes
pure as clotting and viscera
eyes watching; causal symphony movements
celebrated in blood letting ties 
promises rendered in flesh and bone
veins flushed 
surging torrents to sweep away
and embrace
moments of pallor
spun into verse and arcs
of contour and form
your bed an epiphany of sheets and sweat
spumes and canopies
sights and sounds -- in tandem cacophony
choral arrangements
such music: earthy and fecund.

Stripped bare of pretence
naked and form in light and shadow
equally tempting
primal with divinity and such desire
your breath, your eyes
burning touch
kisses seeped in sea salt
heart beats and rain tattooing
each drop a rhythmic sigh
majestic and oceanic
tracing valley and vale
o'er the pores of your skin
thigh and buttock
the rushing of blood
like wings beating
nature personified
entwined between each breath
visceral and deep
between the vast seascape 
reflected from your eyes.

How can such magic be contained? 
vestigial light that falls across
your temporal outlines
illuminated in such detail
the predator heart waits to pounce
while shadows pulsate
and I am transfixed
held fast in your venal light.

Such lunar glow illuminates your lampshade skin.




Prompts:

""Some people are left-handed and some are right-handed. We don't know which you are yet cause you just sit there and let me do the handling . . .This is a kiss. It is what happens when lips are puckered up and pressed against something, sometimes other lips, sometimes a cheek, sometimes something else. It depends. . .This is my heart. You are touching it with your left hand, not because you are left-handed, although you might be, but because I am holding it against my heart. What you are feeling is the beating of my heart. It is what keeps me alive.""

290,YourJuliet,"""a Busy Day on the Farm"" ","my grandparents were up before dawn
 looking out the window - there was no daylight,
 they worked all day and when evening came
 they went to bed when it became night.

the sounds of the morning
 on a farm is always a big delight,
 grandpa grabbed the milk bucket, headed for the barn
 the sun was coming up, but not yet very bright.

several cows would be waiting for him to arrive
 the mules also would be standing very near,
 grandpa emptied the feed into a wooden box
 busy sounds of chewing were so precious to hear.

grandma always wore a feed sack apron
 it would be faded and getting thin,
 apple peelings, a few seeds, or a button to sew on
 she used the pockets to store assorted stuff in.

grandma would be cooking breakfast
 mixing dough for biscuits she planned to bake,
 she fried sausage, eggs and made a skillet of gravy
 these things she knew grandpa on his plate would take.

coffee would be boiling 
sitting on a burner in an old dented pot,
 they liked to make theirs from coffee grounds
 pour a cup and drink while its hot.

in the little glass bowls on the table
 would be sugar, extra spoons and jam,
 sometimes grandma would fry bacon
 or big slices of country ham.

after breakfast it was time to head
 to the front porch and use the broom,
 out in the field the cattle were munching grass
 bees were buzzing 'cause the clover was in bloom.

it was also time to go to the hen house
 grandma gathered eggs and let the chickens roam,
 her dozen or so big fat hens liked to catch bugs
 the red roaster would strut, showing off his stately comb.

the churn held the makings of butter
 lots of hard work lie ahead,
 there was no time to take a nap
 this job must be finished before going to bed.

there was a large garden to plant
 long rows that needed someone to hoe,
 beans, corn, cucumbers, beets and squash
 lots of seeds that she wanted to sow.

in the summer there would be
 loads of canning to be done,
 vegetables, apples and golden ripe pears
 scrub board laundry drying in the sun.

all these things i remember
 as children we often did play,
 spending time on my grandparents farm
 we had adventures in the loft filled with hay.

those childhood days are over
 it's no longer there to see,
 a big white two story farm house
 i have so many treasured memories.

Freeversers Contest - Gentleman Drinker by Mickeyboi
One name you couldn't pin on dad was wino. You could call him an alcoholic, a drunk, a lush, a boozer, a souse, a dipsomaniac, an alky, a toper, and even a soaker. But not a wino. That one term enraged him, broke blood vessels on his cheeks and in his eyes. A wino was someone who bummed on street corners with a brown bags with nothing to do but lift bottles like paper pistols to their mouths. Even as he stumbled to his chair, as he flicked hot ash on his work shirt, my father was a gentleman drinker. Always in a glass, usually with ice. Vodka, rum, gin, clear liquids that burned on the tongue, something a man could hold up to the world and distort the light, but not black it out in a grape abyss. He held a job, never drank before noon, rarely filled a glass more than half-way, sipped rather than swallowed, stirred with a spoon rather than a finger. A man has to have standards and the wino has none, he'd say, then lean over and puke in the ashtray.

Upon the straits;—on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the AEgean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we
Find also in the sound a thought,
Hearing it by this distant northern sea.

The Sea of Faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear",Humor
298,Lulu Gee,Miss Twizzy is Saved,"
	 Whoever would have thought to find

	 atop the sparrow's house.
	 She’d scampered with a hop and leap
	 chased by the portly cat,
	 through cabbages and rows of beans
	 she swerved this way and that,
	 colliding with a duck who quacked
	 whilst shooing ducklings on

	 Miss Twizzy searched for somewhere safe
	 to rest a little while
	 and found herself by Lily lamb
	 who had the sweetest smile.
	 'Twas in the old barn Twizzy sat
	 and twitched her aching paws,

	 And Percy Pig’s loud snores.
	 Then suddenly the portly cat
	 came thund’ring through the door
	 and with a cry each of them shook
	 while Percy honked,  'guffaw.'
	 The day was cloudy, hazy blue
	 with just a hint of breeze,
	 as to and fro the swallows flew
	 with young amongst the trees.
	 And from the very tallest branch
	 upon the tallest tree,
	 Brown owl sat high with squinty eyes
	 while watching Twizzy flee.
	 With squinting eyes he wasn’t sure
	 if she was here nor there,
	 but took a chance to swoop her up,
	 for dinner was now rare.
	 Now all this time the swallows had
	 seen squinty owl drift low
	 and when they saw poor Twizzy caught
	 there where the poppies blow,
	 they dealt a raucous, fierce flight
	 against owl in midair
	 and with such wisdom owl had left,
	 he dropped Miss Twizzy there.

	But they couldn’t get painted ladies out there,

	The sweat would run down her big fat legs,
	but at least twice a month she’d bathe.
	She could drink anyone under the table,
	and could knock you for a row of stumps.
	She wasn’t above slipping you a Mickey,
	and sneaking money from the drunks.
	One night the cowboys got in a fight,
	and someone threw a coal oil lamp.
	It busted and started a fire on the stairs,
	killing Mabel and some poor scamp.
	Part of the two story building still stands,

303,marc creamore,"the Hummingbird Blues Sung to the Tune of Home, Home on the Range","I am greeted this morning by the sound of a harmonica,      
    49 thousand chickadees 
                and the aching voice of the sun
     as it staggers across a skyline littered 
               with cannons and the opus of militant pilots.  
I’ve been waiting at the music hall where all the rituals           
          performed by spawning poets 
                        and prophetic bees go ignored, 
my right hand idly strumming the strings of a dulcimer,                 
                my throat moaning with nuances 
  drawn from the ghostly lungs of Lightning Hopkins 
                             and Charlie Patton.  
   Billie Holiday pumps her veins with brown snow, 
Tim Buckley weeps into a bowl of suffocating goldfish              
              while Blind Boy Grunt and Richard Farina 
      are embraced by Van Ronk’s wife.  
  And just then, at that moment when the cool air 
    of a meadowed fan blesses a choir of cicadas, 
                    Maxwell’s Silver Hammer comes down 
       and shatters all the serenity with a thud 
               that screams for the rebirth of sound bites 
                            that echo in apocalyptic tones.  
So I turn my thirsty ear toward the non hurricane 
       of Joan Baez and abolish Christmas Carols 
                and Celine Dion from my brain.  
Down on Mose Allison’s farm there are locusts 
       disguised as men 
    and as they prod the ribcages of slaves, 
Odetta and Mahalia Jackson sing hymns lest we forget.   
The Byrds crash at Gene Clark’s alcoholic feet, 
    Van Gogh paints a portrait 
                     of Duke Ellington’s fingers 
    while the Emperor of China mistakenly believes 
         that Duane Allman is a great violin player.  
But that’s okay, because there is always 
        Woody Guthrie’s poetic spiderweb to fall into,      
                  always Dan Bern and Bobby Dylan 
carving society’s tombstone with the sharpened edges 
          of their tongues, 
    always Neil Young breaking the strings 
                         of presidential guitars.  
Oh and don’t misplace Sibelius’s swan 
     on a frozen lake of dime store political conventions    
        because Allen Ginsberg chants Blakian rhapsodys 
                  with his harmonium 
      while Phil Ochs smashes empty wine bottles 
                         on the grave of Victor Hara.  
Crazy Horse blows a wooden flute from the clouds 
      above the Dakotas, 
                John Lennon wounds the CIA 
    with a never wilting flower, 
                          Peter Pan marries Lisa Gerrard 
    while I sit in the coffee shop of my mind 
                     whispering the humming bird blues 


                      with a smile upon my face.

Gold-lined crimson, fluttering raggedly in the wind. 
Five flying banners, blood red, snapping in the tugging night air.
A lone white flag, drooping listlessly in the middle. 
Surrounded by chaos, yet remaining undisturbed.


Sparkling blue looks upon stormy grey
Courageous eyes scan a distant horizon

Looking for wisps of treachery

Vigilant sentries line the decks,




Looking for a sign, a sound, a sight

Swirling mists enclose the fragrant waves, droplets intermixing



Giant grey pillars, soaring, hiding the blue horizon

Approaching cliffs sparkle, hailing the new dawn



 

Red blood, staining pure, crisp, white linen


Dripping slowly from her gaping side, her body

folds, tumbling to the floor

A soft but pitiful sigh escapes her parted lips


Her last breath, her last shudder, her last.


Scarlet pooling away.


Gradual, inevitable, insatiable




 


The abyss, night, jet blackness


Glossy, all encompassing 


Her hair


Beauty incarnate 


Stark against emerald eyes, blazing


Momentary silence, caused just by her radiant grace




 


Crisp, fresh, awakening


The first breath catches, brings full alertness


The frigid chill of morning frost, tinges fragrant

pine scented air

Bracing, icy, crystalline

324,Billy Collins,Pinup,"
	The murkiness of the local garage is not so dense
	that you cannot make out the calendar of pinup
	drawings on the wall above a bench of tools.
	Your ears are ringing with the sound of
	the mechanic hammering on your exhaust pipe,
	and as you look closer you notice that this month's
	is not the one pushing the lawn mower, wearing
	a straw hat and very short blue shorts,
	her shirt tied in a knot just below her breasts.
	Nor is it the one in the admiral's cap, bending
	forward, resting her hands on a wharf piling,
	glancing over the tiny anchors on her shoulders.
	No, this is March, the month of great winds,
	so appropriately it is the one walking her dog
	along a city sidewalk on a very blustery day.
	One hand is busy keeping her hat down on her head
	and the other is grasping the little dog's leash,
	so of course there is no hand left to push down
	her dress which is billowing up around her waist
	exposing her long stockinged legs and yes the secret
	apparatus of her garter belt. Needless to say,
	in the confusion of wind and excited dog
	the leash has wrapped itself around her ankles
	several times giving her a rather bridled
	and helpless appearance which is added to
	by the impossibly high heels she is teetering on.
	You would like to come to her rescue,
	gather up the little dog in your arms,
	untangle the leash, lead her to safety,
	and receive her bottomless gratitude, but
	the mechanic is calling you over to look
	at something under your car. It seems that he has
	run into a problem and the job is going
	to cost more than he had said and take
	much longer than he had thought.
	Well, it can't be helped, you hear yourself say
	as you return to your place by the workbench,
	knowing that as soon as the hammering resumes
	you will slowly lift the bottom of the calendar
	just enough to reveal a glimpse of what
	the future holds in store: ah,

	upturned palm extended coyly into the rain.

 claret lips like a single - rose blossomed slowly
smiling so ever 
contently to the high .

 Sitting by the seaside
 followed a estranged path
 which she found
a golden clam shell
that seemed to ridge like a wave
so ever white- titanium white 
it seemed so solid that it flowed down.

The violin played so smooth 
that it seemed to flow for infinity
that seemed to be closed to my Vincenty.
She seemed to dance so gracefully and full
she never took a breath that moment that seemed so dull.

By the moonlight her
 shining face seemed so bright
a crowd of people that seemed to be in delight
they watched her perform 
like a dancer should
she put her effort.

 in to her dream all she could
as the waves crashed hard 
and the wind seemed wild
her arms
 her flow seemed to fill with
 enegery that was like a chain.

Had the television on and the news was showing a videotape
of an explosive event that occurred at the Circus and I couldn’t
believe my eyes! My mouth dropped open and a monster
mosquito flew in. I doused it down with my morning liquid
as I continued to watch the film about the festival preceding
the beginning of the performance to be held. The electricity
inside the tent briefly went out, then a feather which had
caught fire somehow, ignited the dung that the elephant dropped.
A floodlight came on and the frightened animal tried
to run up the staircase! The audience went through a spectrum
of emotions as the event left its signature on their minds!

She felt me touching her in ways
we hadn't tried for many days.
I started at her neck this time
and slowly traced a downward line
past the quivering small of her back
then changed the angle of attack.
Touched one shoulder, as a lover
gently too caressed the other.
Across her breast my hand did travel
stopping just below her navel.
Next as, ever exuding charm
I traced along her inner arm
down the side I gaily tripped
and stopped so softly on her hip.
Then started on the right hand side
my urgency was not denied
brushed her buttocks carefully then
down her leg, began again.
and as my hand which nearly begged
made it's way up the inside leg.
I abruptly stopped and then rolled over
am I an attentive lover?
	 
Quite aroused she in a strop
asked me why the heck I stopped
Gently then I cleared my throat
said,"" O.K. dear I found the Remote.""

We Bear What We Must 
(Ode to My Spine)
An arsonist runs gleefully, set loose 
with a box of matches and a gallon jug of kerosene;
his long wicks' black snake trail with sparks as he slithers past.
He exists within my crumbling spine, 
the bastard son of a wayward nun 
who frolicked once too often, her habits whipping; 
she met and mated with a maddened meteorologist 
who greedily gathered clouds in his spare moments,
captured them in mason jars like so many fireflies,
then dropped them from his dusky, drooping hand
to shatter on concrete, his tempests no longer denied. 
He destroyed landscapes and crops 
with his bad-tempered droughts and floods,
then reaped a whirlwind for his dark seductions,
his unknown demise gone unnoticed by the unfrocked sister
who bore his strange seed, then disappeared into a desert 
somewhere south of there, leaving the child twisted into naught
by her dust storms and tumbleweeds, her progeny ill-suited 
for taunts and insults he would not endure in silence.
His eyes were daggers unsheathed
and pleading for a taste of blood and now that his tongue 
has devoured this sour scorn, he seeks to destroy all 
he touches, clapping his hands with thundering delight,
tenderness being such a foreign substance. 
I would cut him out myself if my hands could meet, 
without trembling, in the middle, without fracturing 
what keeps me semi-whole and barely standing. 
Instead, I must tolerate this unkempt squatter, 
this tenant of unrestrained terror. 
Each day, I curse his presence 
as he unleashes his jaded, jagged laughter 
tucked beneath the fiery folds of my flesh. 
Picture: ""Sorrow"" by Roger Moore (I photoshopped it into a blue tint)
Here's an explanation, if one is needed: my neck and spine have been in terrible trouble since I was 19 ... and I'll be 57 in September 2015. In 1988, my neurosurgeon said he would have to fuse vertebra together in several places in my neck alone ... and then, when I saw him again in 2000, he said the rest of my spine would also require fusion in at least 3-5 more places ... and even if I survived the surgery and even if it was successful, I'd be in worse shape than I already was, partly because of my Graves disease ... and, more than likely, I'd have to have it done again in 5-10 years as the ""cure"" would not, could not last ... let alone the fact that the appliances were as big as plumbing fixtures ... We came to the mutual conclusion that I would put off having any other surgeries (I'd already had 5 surgical procedures done in about 7 years in the 1980's alone) until I could no longer stand the pain of it all ... no matter how hunched over, however curled, even fetal I have been, I'm still ""standing"" it, somehow ... In addition to the Graves disease, I also have degenerative disc disease ( C-4 through C7, reversed curvature in 1988) spinal stenosis, fibromyalgia, herniated discs, including lumbar ... because of the chronic, long-term nature of these maladies, and the strain and pain it causes, it affects my ability to sleep, as well. Yeah, it pretty much sucks. But it could always be worse ...

347,Beret55,Ode to a bad day,"
	One hot and windy West Texas day,
	somewhere along about high noon.
	The local normal everyday crowd ,
	gathered at the Dry Gulch Saloon.
	Big Mabel was the upstairs Queen,
	but she was downstairs swilling beer.
	The card tables were all filled up,
	laughter and cursing was all you hear.
	Then all at once everything went quiet,
	no one spoke a word anymore.
	All eyes were wide and staring in fear,
	Black Bart was standing in the door.
	A brand new coal black John B Stetson hat,
	a shiny black silk shirt so fine.
	He wore Black leather pants and vest,
	and his boots so black they shine.
	But the thing that got their attention,
	and had them all cringing so.
	Was the two pearl handled colt 44s,
	that he wore tied down and low.
	Bart said “I’m gonna kill someone,
	I’m looking for a stranger”.
	“I heard he just rode into town,
	and he’s a Texas Ranger.”
	Chairs and tables started turning over,
	glasses and poker chips hit the floor.
	Big Mabel dove through the window,
	she couldn’t make it to the door.
	The saloon had cleared except for the
	old Texas Ranger sitting in the corner.
	He slowly rose up from his chair and said.
	“Come with me or you’re a goner.”
	Bart went for both his guns ,
	and they came out a blazing.
	But the Ranger in his old white hat
	had speed that was amazing.
	When the smoke had finally cleared
	all the folks out side were wait’n.
	They knew that Black Bart would win
	and that’s something they’d  be hate’n.
	But when the saloon doors swung wide,
	the old Texas Ranger stepped out and spat.
	He walked over and mounted his faithful steed,
	and was wearing a black John B Stetson hat.
	P.N.

	 
	The rest of the story:
	Big Mabel
	Remember  before Black Bart pulled his guns
	to try and shoot down the Texas Ranger.
	Everyone in the Dry Gulch Saloon
	knew they were in danger.
	Everyone headed for the door,
	and were fighting to get out.
	Big Mabel knew she couldn’t get through,
	so she found another route.
	Now Mabel didn’t take in account,
	the sharpness of the glass.
	When she dove through the window,
	and landed on her a**.
	Big Mabel started jumping around,
	holding places I won’t mention.
	But the gun fight was going on inside,
	so no one paid her any attention.
	But when the gun fight was over
	and the crowd had settled down.
	All eyes were turned to Big Mabel,
	while she screamed and jumped around.
	The men all grabbed and held her,
	pulled her dress up and bloomers down.
	The sight was really nothing different
	for most of the local gentry in town.
	“Go get the Dr.” Was shouted out
	by one of the old geezers.
	“And be sure to make him hurry,
	and bring a set of tweezers”.
	The saloon keeper (in his concern for her)
	said, “Get her inside and on a table”.
	He knew if she was inside the saloon,
	he could charge for a peek at Mabel.
	Poor Mabel could not do anything,
	laying on the table facing down.
	While the Dr. used his tweezers,
	and the gawkers stood around.
	But she was alive and soon would mend,
	and Mabel had one consolation.
	Until her gluteus maximus healed
	she’d have a well earned vacation.

	had speed that was amazing.
	When the smoke had finally cleared
	all the folks out side were wait’n.
	They knew that Black Bart would win
	and that’s something they’d  be hate’n.
	But when the saloon doors swung wide,
	the old Texas Ranger stepped out and spat.
	He walked over and mounted his faithful steed,
	and was wearing a black John B Stetson hat.
	P.N.

	 

	 


	 
	The rest of the story:
	Big Mabel
	Remember  before Black Bart pulled his guns
	to try and shoot down the Texas Ranger.
	Everyone in the Dry Gulch Saloon
	knew they were in danger.
	Everyone headed for the door,
	and were fighting to get out.
	Big Mabel knew she couldn’t get through,
	so she found another route.
	Now Mabel didn’t take in account,
	the sharpness of the glass.
	When she dove through the window,
	and landed on her a**.
	Big Mabel started jumping around,
	holding places I won’t mention.
	But the gun fight was going on inside,
	so no one paid her any attention.
	But when the gun fight was over
	and the crowd had settled down.
	All eyes were turned to Big Mabel,
	while she screamed and jumped around.
	The men all grabbed and held her,
	pulled her dress up and bloomers down.
	The sight was really nothing different
	for most of the local gentry in town.
	“Go get the Dr.” Was shouted out
	by one of the old geezers.
	“And be sure to make him hurry,
	and bring a set of tweezers”.
	The saloon keeper (in his concern for her)
	said, “Get her inside and on a table”.
	He knew if she was inside the saloon,
	he could charge for a peek at Mabel.
	Poor Mabel could not do anything,
	laying on the table facing down.
	While the Dr. used his tweezers,
	and the gawkers stood around.
	But she was alive and soon would mend,
	and Mabel had one consolation.
	Until her gluteus maximus healed
	she’d have a well earned vacation.

358,MartinP,A Sibling's Prerogative,"A thin, high, tinnitus voice squeaks out – a mouse’s
squeak that, straining, I can just about recognise:
it’s Linda, Jim’s sister. (He’s just called at my house
to drop some weed off, and – not much of a surprise –

no sooner has he stumbled – wasted - through my door
than his mobile phone’s rung, shrilly, interrupting
the handover.) He smiles down shyly at the floor
and says, ‘hi sis: what now?’, a half-smoked spliff cupped in

his other hand. She sounds impatient, strident, loud.
‘Yeah, uh huh,’ he stutters out, then abruptly stops…
…as she stamps her mark across a face quickly cowed
and turning a spiky shade of red. His mouth pops

open like a fish but with very little luck
as another well-aimed tirade strikes, and grumbles
into grumpy acquiescence. It seems his pluck’s 
run out: ‘uh, yeah, uh huh,’ he sheepishly mumbles

and then, ‘uh huh, uh huh’ – like an outboard motor
reluctant to start, a record caught in a groove;
‘yeah sis, uh hum, um, yeah’. I could swear I caught a
piece of shrapnel - a red-hot shard of her reproof,

a dumdum ricochet to the effect that he
is a dope-dumb fool, too stoned to pay attention;
that he wanders through life, a space cadet, carefree,
sporting piss-poor short-term memory retention.

‘Uh huh, yeah well, umm…’ - his ill-considered response,
‘er, yeah, so?…’ - her airstrike clearly devastating.

360,Padraig,The Poetry Reading,"
I went to a reading last Saturday week,
Of poetry, prose and of verse.
For the lass that I love is a poetry fan.
Some things, I suppose, could be worse.
The poet in charge was an odd-looking cove.
With blue-tinted specs on his nose,
And a pink chiffon scarf tied tight ‘round his neck.
For added effect, I suppose.
This soirée was held in a room at The Bull.
A place of some doubtful repute.
Where T-shirts prevailed, and I swear I smelt puff.
I felt over-dressed in my suit.
Chief poet stood up to announce the first turn
“Some poetry sapphic this time”.
He droned on and on, with ‘is dark gloomy poem,
And never once got it to rhyme.
With a pint in his hand, and froth on his ‘tash,
And his free hand scratching his groin.
‘E told of King Bill and some Fenian lads,
Who’d had a big scrap on the Boyne.
Next blue-specs comes back, with a grin for my lass.
Smiling, and saying he’d treat her,
“To frolics and fun, and tales tenderly told,
In clear am-phi-bra-chic meter”.
A woman was perched on the edge of a stool,
In jeans with some holes in the knee.
“There was a young lady of Warwick” she starts.
Seemed just like a Lim’rick to me.
Then some soldiers came in, from a room next door.
And asked “Can we join in the fun?”
They did  “Eskimo Nell” and old “Piddlin’ Pete” 
Then encored with “Nelly the Nun”.
Poor poetry bloke, he was getting quite miffed.
Miff showing all over his mush.
For people were cheering and clapping their hands,
And poet kept shouting for hush.
With a shrug and a grin, the poet gave in.
He’d lost all sense of decorum
As folks thanked the lads for kindly performing,
This forces poetry for ‘em.
The night was not all a resounding success.
 Me drinking strong ale by the yard.
 At chucking-out time I quite suddenly found,
My lass had gone home. With the bard!

	But disaster struck that night

	when a waskly wabbit came about

	so he pulled a blow dryer out.

	 

	He said to had the gold

	over to him right quick

	but the snowman didn't want to

	so he showed him his broomstick.

	 

	His lovely snow lady

	was proud of her figure too

	and didn't want to melt the pounds

	for she would be so blue.

	 

	She told him to give in

     I wake up and find myself fried in a 115 degree small and sun-bleached valley with people creaking about sporting false joints totally obsessed with a game they call, God-Only-Loves-Fools. Here, sun-crinkled hominids, way past the age of cognitive reasoning, clad in Easter outfits, hit hard-boiled eggs around a water-starved field used for flood control, guzzling water drawn from mineralized sand splashed with toxically fermented cactus juice in plastic liter jugs with tiny umbrellas that poke out of the top for heat resistance.
     Unable to walk any longer, they travel around in motorized baby buggies carrying laundry bags full of vacuum cleaner handles as if afraid that they might get attacked by coyotes.
     The object of this game is to see who can ruin their rotator cuff the fastest to be the first one to miss Happy Hour or Senior Dinner Special to inhabit a club named Urgent Care.
     There they sit, C-shaped, in spine-splintering chairs in an over air-conditioned tomb staring at a tiny TV attached to the ceiling while being audience to stern-faced, nurse-want-to-be's, acting out another game called, board-to-death, on a real-life TV set in a far corner.

Oh Creativity,
Whither hast thou gone?
It is more difficult to write
	In a dentist’s waiting room,
	Than on the roof of a barn.
	From there, I would see trees
	And dappled horses
	In orchards
	Of fallen apples.
	Clouds fluffy in a sky
	Of horizons blue
	From East to West
	North to South
	And back again, too.
	But in the dentist’s room, here
	All I see is
	A dentist’s chair
	A diabolical contraption
	With straps and snaps
	And shiny silver bowls
	To catch the craps,
	The drool, stew and vomit
	From the mouths of his helpless patients
	Who ate things far too sweet
	And now have buckwheat teeth.
	The drill is sharp and poisonous
	It makes an unearthly noisiness,
	Screaming like a banshee
	As it makes holes in rotting teeth.
	(My poor wife –
	I trusted the dentist with her life).
	Then, the dentist stuffed her gums, 
	With TNT
	And shouted at me:
	“FIRE IN THE HOLE!”
	“Well now,” said the dentist,
	When the smoke cleared,
	“The pain is GONE!”
	“And so is my wife,” I said,
	Staring disbelievingly
	At the hole in the floor.
	“Trust me,” said the dentist,
	“That’s the best I could do –
	No more pain and wife gone – 
	What more can you ask?”
	“Well, is it free?”
	I said tearfully,
	“Oh no,” said the dentist,
	“The bill is $4,673.”

395,Christopher Staab,L.A. to New Orlean's- The Excursion,"My journey began outside
	Union Station in Los Angeles,
	where I was sleeping on a grassy
	hill across the street.  I was soon
	interupted by a security guard,
	""Get up, you can't sleep here"".
	""Ok"", I answered, so I got up
	and was swept up by the lavish
	detail attributed to the golden
	train station looking at me head
	on.  I went in and starting thinking
	where do I want to go until at last,
	New Orlean's came into focus.
	A city filled with squatters and
	homeless people, I thought, ""I will
	fit right in"".
	I boarded the train on that October
	morning and the first person I met
	was a pony tailed, gator eating, Baton
	Rouge native sipping cold Budwieser
	until he was drunk enough to start
	going through people's luggage.  Police
	soon got word of his transactions and
	detained the wild man in New Mexico,
	he would not make it to Lousiana that
	day. 
	My surroundings were as mild as milk
	going through New Mexico and Texas.
	It was like going through a ghost town
	in the desert and I was getting bored
	so I walked onto the part of the train where
	they had tables and people drinking and
	talking about and came encountered
	with a woman named Sandy.  She had
	spider web stalkings on, thigh high,
	knee boats, and a tank top.  Something
	was a little off about her and I soon got
	word that she might have been a man
	before but she was insteresting, so I decided
	to talk with her for a while.  I found out
	she was going to New Orlean's as well and
	that she was planning on sleeping in a park.
	I thought, ""Well, hell that sounds like a
	great idea"".  Our chat lasted through Texas
	until we got to New Orlean's.  The beers
	helped and the scenery got a little better
	through lush Louisaina.  The swamps
	were something that lured me too the area.
	People hunting gators and those little
	rat like creatures running around.
	The train rattled into the station and
	we parted ways.  I went my way and Sandy
	went hers.  Never met her again but I
	will always remember that train ride
	where the people were as true to their
	word as vinegar.prompt-  A tale about a train ride ©  on Nov 04 2013 11:20 AM",Humor

408,penman,The Big Splash,"Ethel and Nancy dreamed of long white beaches
from their homes in the Mid west,
two teachers with boring lives
just wanted to head out to the coast
for they had heard about life guards
how they had extra large equipment
and it would spill so very much,
hey figured it was time
on their vacation to get so filled up.

In the seats of the jet plane
their voices cooed their expectancy,
convinced they'd be riding 
some life guard’s stiff surf board
let his sea cucumber squirt a wave or two
leaving them drowning from the experience.

Yeah, they got those bikinis ready
went to a tanning salon to be sure they were bronze,
then in their rental car they followed the map
where it said there as a great beach in Southern California.

Oh they were wet already between the thighs
from imagining soon some heated squirting
would be happening so hot and steamy
when that tight lifeguard’s body
came to their rescue.

So they strutted out on the sand,
getting so aroused by the moment,
smiling so wide from dreaming of a sea cucumber’s 
throbbing thrust were they needed it the most.

Then spied the lifeguard’s shack
nearly shook from the anticipation,
until they caught a glimpse of that surf god!



Was quite the sight they wanted
reluctantly leaving to check out 
the help back at the hotel,
because no sense trying to milk 
that life guard’s sea cucumber
long enough to make it spill
since they imagined in his case
it was only four inches long.

This poem was really fun to write. I love bluegrass as much as I use to love punk rock (quite a switch, right). I think it is the practicality of bluegrass that gets me. Anyway, I am a Christian as well, but I don't know where I stand on the Anarchy issue. I am sure I don't agree with pure anarchy, but I do believe in what looks like anarchy, the internalizing of what is right into the society to the point where life just works. Although, I don't know what I think about that either. I am definitely the young kid with all the ideals, although I wasn't exactly all for Democracy. If anything I was one of those anarchists that the prompt for this contest described as being associated with punk rock. I remember having these conversations with people I thought were simple and dumb, that replied to my idealism with a smart remark. I now see life as much more complicated, and I might be hopeless,but don't see a human solution to our problems this side of eternity. In other words, just like the musicians, the form of government doesn't matter to me, humans are going to oppress others and humans will fight with eachother one way or another and I feel like I am here to protect the oppressed and spread the saving grace of Christ, which is probably a naive approach and has gotten me scolden and called idealistic. Being called idealistic now seems funny because my ideal is unattainable through human means, and my idea of society is overly complicated and in no way simple now or after Christ comes.

The laburnum branches cascading down like a static waterfall within which restless birds chirrup and call.The dog rushes in gay abandon hither thither investigating little nooks and crannies making the whole garden quiver. Around the garden  privet towers high and green a living barrier surrounding and protecting the enclosed scene.The tree proudly covered in apples blushing healthy red an ancient English strain upon which generations have fed.In the greenery life and iris filled, lies a hidden pond, frogs now gone but newts and dragon flies inhabit the surrounding frondThe dog still barking enjoying this most English of places sniffing at the various scents up and down the garden he races. Dragon and plumb flies dart in and out whilst wasps and bees busily gathering  pollen fly frenetically about.Honeysuckle adds to the heavy laden sweet smell of the garden where flora and fauna in happy chaos dwell. An oasis of natural beauty teaming with growth and life a perfect resting place to escape modern living and strife For those who liked the poem attached here is a short film taken in my garden the poem is narrated by me just click on the URL to watch-I hope you enjoy ithttp://youtu.be/mBA_VgqjP98

Around the garden  privet towers high and green a living barrier surrounding and protecting the enclosed scene.
The tree proudly covered in apples blushing healthy red an ancient English strain upon which generations have fed.
In the greenery life and iris filled, lies a hidden pond, frogs now gone but newts and dragon flies inhabit the surrounding frond
The dog still barking enjoying this most English of places sniffing at the various scents up and down the garden he races. 
Dragon and plumb flies dart in and out whilst wasps and bees busily gathering  pollen fly frenetically about.
Honeysuckle adds to the heavy laden sweet smell of the garden where flora and fauna in happy chaos dwell. 
An oasis of natural beauty teaming with growth and life a perfect resting place to escape modern living and strife
 For those who liked the poem attached here is a short film taken in my garden the poem is narrated by me just click on the URL to watch-I hope you enjoy it

423,Ms.Juliet,Doggy Dog Days’,"The smell of summer watered fresh cut green grass. Grass stained knees and hands. I would play puppies with my four dogs. I was the baby puppy of my two Rottweiler Ellie and Jethrow, and the little sister of my Rottweiler Molly and some kind of Spaniel Jake. I would stomp all over my Aunt’s and Uncle’s yard. They had this hill that looked like a huge mountain when I would be on my hands and knees in their yard. I would run back and forth pretending I was a little Rottweiler puppy. It was so much fun. The hills looked like mountain, the sky was a blue with white clouds and a yellow ball shining down on me and my dog family. ©  on Mar 05 2010 02:36 AM, Brittney Hafner   life  • love  • nature  • other  • spiritual  • thoughts  • humor  • ",Humor

428,Doctor Z,The Barber of Severe,"I sat in the seat high above the floor'Cause I didn't want long hair anymore.Razor- sharp scissors clipped the airAs the barber prepared to cut my hair.
Sharpened silver scissors sang snip, snip, snip,As showers of hair coated nose and lip.Since my hands were under an apron's embrace,I couldn't reach the itches on my tortured face!
A tickling irritation on the tip of my noseGrew so great that my heartbeat froze.When I finally vented an explosive sneeze,My head lurched downward between my knees.
The startled barber then lost his commandAnd grazed my skull with a swipe of his hand.My head got clear-cut down through the center;I looked like a clown or a crazy inventor.
After some thinking, I chose to have finishedWhat volcanic sneezing only diminished.I had my head shaved so that I could start over,And raise a new crop like alfalfa or clover!

bouncing balls off the wall;

kicking off his boots and socks; 
taking jabs of hard knocks to his face,
in disgrace it's now soft as jelly; flabby as his belly,
he jumps over the juniper bush, with a big push;
he falls on his cush, racing to get to the deli; 
before the big joust, to be seated and ready to
munch on his lunch from the deli, shaking his big round belly; 
he grouses about his spouse, who deals joker's out to the crowd; 
with a straight poker face and a smoker dangling from her
lip, as the other court jesters flip and dip throughout

436,Debbie Embrey,The Mule,"
A man goes into a barroom and the bartender tells him he will give him $500.00 if he can make his jackass laugh. The man takes him up on it. He goes outside, whispers in the mule's ear, and all of a sudden the animal starts laughing.
Then he came in to get his money and he left the barroom and town.
Five years later he came back into town and stopped at the same bar, and the bartender recognized him. He offered him another $500.00 if he could make his jackass cry.
The man once again took him up on the offer and went outside for a few moments, and upon his return, the bartender saw that his jackass was crying. The bartender gasped, ''Oh my goodness! What did you do to make my jackass laugh and cry?''
The man said, ''The first time I was here I told him I was better looking than he was, and the mule just started laughing.'' Then the guy added, ''This time, I brought my mirror with me to show him, and he just started to cry.''

442,Becks,Friday Goth,". 

             Once upon a time (all great stories begin this way), there was a little girl named Friday Goth. She had long black hair and skin as pale as milk. Mommy and Daddy Goth were Undead Zombies. All three of them lived in a big black mansion in the cemetery. Friday went to sleep in a coffin bed and woke up at twilight every evening. She often played tag at midnight with her best friends, the Ghost Sisters. They always won (she couldn’t touch them), but that was okay. 
    
             One night, when Friday Goth turned eight years old, she was taking her pet bat, Vlad, for a fly among the path of tombstones in her front yard. Her birthday party was soon! The guests were arriving at promptly half past two, and Friday Goth was dressed in her best attire—a burgundy dress with black lace detail (her Mommy sewed it). Her hair was pinned back with blood-red coffin clamps, and a black ribbon leash was tied firmly around her wrist; Vlad must not run amuck! 

             When the tower-clock struck the hour, her friends began to appear one by one. Friday Goth had many, and they all brought presents. Everyone praised the decorations. Friday had chosen them herself! Burgundy paper ribbon and black balloons to match her dress. Her Mommy baked the coffin cake and decorated it with black frosting. 

             The Ghost Sisters each sang her a lovely song about the black plague that was Friday’s favorite. Zoul, the vampire boy, brought her a vial of blood to wear around her neck on a pretty chain. Daddy Goth gave her new combat boots with black glitter bats on them. But alas! Soon, the party was over. Friday bid her friends a morbid day and went to bed. She lived gothly ever after. The end.

464,Dlmchale,Memory of My Life,"
I have walked a thousand country miles -
watched the falcons pirouette in the summer sky;
lunched upon bitter green apples and fermented mangoes
and napped beneath the hot luminous clock;
quenched my thirst with melodious silver spring water 
and skipped stones across frozen lakes.
I’ve immortalized poets against the echoing granite walls of time.
In bare feet I danced in verdant green meadows
that carpet a bottomless valley; 
traced my fingertips along the gnarled grooves
 of a dying oak and bid it farewell.
I have bathed in babbling brooks that giggled at 
my nakedness and dried myself in the wispy autumn winds.
Upon mountaintops, I have squeezed sunsets between
my forefinger and thumb and slowly opened them again to
the shimmering glow of a new moon.
I have slept beneath a canopy of universes and composed 
my dreams against shimmering stars;
built wet sandcastles fit for kings on foreign shores
and fed them to the ravenous surf.
Beneath cascading waterfalls were written tumbling
verse, while angelfish nibbled at my dropped metaphors.
In the Mascarene Islands, I flew kites built from 
forest reeds and raffia palms until they were swallowed
by drifting winter clouds.
The return to a new day awaits me, and a thousand more
miles beneath my feet before this life is drawn full circle.
Awakening a memory, I close my eyes 
and the colors of life’s possibilities explode beneath my lids.

	listened to the thump of rubber against
	the steel radiators. The fog spun ‘round
	the walls. Sleep was falling down tunnels
	ghosts pressed against windows,
	the wind on the face and becoming 
	a bird, hollow bones lighter than air. 
	He felt it before he saw it. The vibration
	like a heartbeat. The heart beat causing 
	him to hold his breath. Then the gray 
	gloom became solid with horses galloping 
	across the moor. They had come.
	He heard the neighing and the manes
	tossed like sea foam danced through the fog. 
	He leaned forward and strained to raise
	the window. He called out names, Star Dust
	Wind Racer, Gray Walker and they came,
	through the fog, out of the dark thunder of trees.
	He called and they shook their heads and closed 
	in upon the window. He reached out and felt 
	their hot breath on his hand, heard them nicker 
	as he rubbed them between their eyes. Laughing with joy
	crying, cause he would not ride again in this lifetime.

	rocked the wheels of the chair 

	listened to the thump of rubber against

	the walls. Sleep was falling down tunnels

	gloom became solid with horses galloping 

	across the moor. They had come.

	He heard the neighing and the manes

	tossed like sea foam danced through the fog. 

	 

	He leaned forward and strained to raise

	the window. He called out names, Star Dust

	Wind Racer, Gray Walker and they came,

	through the fog, out of the dark thunder of trees.

	He called and they shook their heads and closed 

	in upon the window. He reached out and felt 

	their hot breath on his hand, heard them nicker 

	as he rubbed them between their eyes. Laughing with joy

	crying, cause he would not ride again in this lifetime.

478,myriad-dark,The Noise of Traffic ,"Touched like a fist through shredded newspaper
Anger unhealed; beaten as if by angels wings
Momentum of traffic unfurling metal
Endlessly;
And still the madness bubbles up
A gentle nudge and over the top you go
Into shadows and asphalt
The fumes stinking up your nostrils
Like overturned rubbish bins
and carried aloft with the noise of traffic.

Golden handshakes; taxman delight
Hasty hand jobs; the boys are back in town
A face glimpsed briefly on the edge of the chaos
At the beggars banquet -- then gone
Upturned images; relections in the river --
the unforgiving river Styx.

I don't believe in stock futures
Living in my car is an alternate reality
Maintaining radio silence
In case they find me
Choruses of mongrels going through rubbish bins
Chorals of the city
As lightning creases storm clouds gathering.

The anger palpable
Traffic noise building; dynamos screaming
Whores dancing to the city beat
Motel disco madness
Unmade beds; stained mattresses
The rage of humanity -- inhuman
Like prayers of contrition
A litany of traffic psalms
Gateways and portals -- visions prophetic
Prayers to the memory of some childhood deity
Perhaps still listening above the noise of traffic.

486,Kathleen a Nazarene,Balaam’s Donkey,"

In the morning Balaam rose and saddled his donkey,
going with the princes of Moab.
IAH’S anger ignited and He sent an angel to stand in the way.
The donkey saw the angel with drawn sword,
and she turned into the field out of the way.
Balaam struck the ass to turn her onto the path.
The angel stood in the road of the vineyard, a wall on either side.
Seeing the angel again she pushed herself into the wall,
crushing Balaam’s foot, and he whacked her again.
The angel stood guard in a narrow place
and there was no where to turn.
With the angel in her sights she fell under Balaam,
in his anger he beat her with a staff.
IAH opened the ass’s mouth and she asked Balaam
why he’d struck her these three times.
He said that she mocked him; she said she never wanted to!
The angel asked why Balaam treated her so, when she was
protecting him from slaying Balaam and would save herself!
Aware of the angel as adversary, he agreed to turn back.

Nu 22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.:22 And IAH’S anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of IAH [Heb ~ The Eternal] stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.:23 And the ass saw the angel of IAH standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.:24 But the angel of IAH stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.:25 And when the ass saw the angel of IAH, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.:26 And the angel of IAH went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.:27 And when the ass saw the angel of IAH, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.:28 And IAH opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.:31 Then IAH opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of IAH standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me: {to...: Heb. to be an adversary unto thee} :33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again

Two quintain stanzas of twelve syllable lines with either identical or slant rhyme partners in a formula I have been playing with: a-a-b-c-c, b-b-d-e-e.  Part II is merely ""freeverse-in-fixed"" stanzas of a quintain-nature.  In real-life, there is no such thing, but it makes easier reading.

Several years ago, I wrote a novel about an incident that happened to me on NOVEMBER 1, 1968 and I wrote it nearly verbatum to the official report.  The event stuck in my mind because it involved prophetic dreaming, telepathy, angels, and an out-of-body experience.  Somewhere in my life, I lost the manuscript, and I tried to re-create the accuracy of the Marine Corps version.  I failed in my attempts.  But, with pain from a recent stomach virus, the story emerged as a ""dream/nightmare"" of an event occurring a few days before the aforementioned date.  These two parts are the beginning of my novel and this presentation consisted of five pages in the book.  The total number of pages was sixty-two, single-space, typewritten 8X11 paper.  The first lines of the novel were:

As in pouring oil on troubled seas
so should they be put to sword and flame?
tired and destitute they seek the quietude of sobriquet psalms
to be laid at his sandalled feet
yet not to be nailed to the tree of sorrows
but to wander desert roads of dark science and Babylonian indifference
is this but a moment's reflection?
a masterpiece of contrived absent thought spread as feeling
and emotional retort set out in primal despair
its roots planted in the clouds and hung from gibbets and gallows
a sour milk sea of desolation to drown in
 In subliminal day dreams directional yet unfulfilled with proximity
a deep solitude under pain of death
and bleak skeletal remains of a barbaric earth with her nascent cup overflowing.

So strike the black tent before the undertakings perish

relinquishing control to the decimating darkness there
amid asylums where chaos and madness lay entwined  
still waters lapping at redolent shores
rusted razor blades set poised to strike at murderous hearts
as willpower falters when dreams fail
where saints mark time with batons poised to fall
O Wearisome memory stop your barbed embraces
let me draw breath once more and relieve this ache 
so I may once again walk free of such incumbent burden
unlike so much that has gone before and drawn out
to be laid bare like purple and bloody shrouds 
thus with a flick of the wrist all is revealed as illusory 
and the fading echoes still reverberating from that which was.

498,CarolDesjarlais,To The God-Seeking Man - for JustRob,"He has been looking for god
in the bobble of sandpipers on crusty beach
and all the time, god was lapping at his feet,
foaming at the mouth in order for him to see
and know that even gods get desperate
to be seen and heard, felt and tasted

he looked and saw a trotting deer
stiff-legged leap over crooked fence
leaning on crooked land
punctuated by the dim drill
of funereal bells, lunging
against a gold-twist rope
dragging a limp-wristed priest to his tiptoes
with every gong that frightens 
prey from the silver glint
of the gun that would have sacrificed him

a banded wolverine, grew long teeth
waiting for him to come to his senses
and either leave the land 
or lie down to ponder cloud-gods
in a paper sky that someone planted heaven in

drumming hind feet of a jackrabbit
mimics partridge pound and, were he to press
his partially torn ear to ground, he would hear
Chinese gold Buddha’s chanting
in god’s voice

white-throated hawk, hovered over
exact spot that his last supper came from
and even that did not distract the man
from his careful crawl over downfalls
that made him struggle against
silence for a feather of hope that he would see
golden glint of god in a dropped mouse eye
that had seen the sacred lake
because she gave the wolf her seeing

an otter, slipped down his self-made slide
and became a cap for Metis sacre’ blue
breath on winter’s cruel lisp of a half-frozen god

raccoon knocked twice until the world split open
and a pearl un-gutted itself for him,
if only he had walked by the river
where he could have been dipped
on the third day of darkness

green gangly moss, grew on the north
for any other direction was too harsh,
too hard to sustain itself for long
in the white lace of a virgin ancestor
left too long in her bridal bower
while the groom crawled on his belly
like garter snake that needs his nest
and takes any hole that he can fit in to

cottonwood trees, tucked their pads
in appropriate places and waited his seeding
with chastity belts of tumbleweed
hiding the rude awakening in some damned garden
that being female discarded his notice
that a creator is a creator, 
even co-creation counts
had he dropped his belief that patriarchy
points to a pope or the pious enough to parade
brick paths lined with Montezuma’s gold
hidden under bones and stones
from sad sacrifices to ones who knew
the grim glare of shining things
could bring yellow hair to the ground
with bleeding ears draining the hope to hear
even an angel’s voice as the last sound on earth

oh, god was there, young man, in white wings
that sailed across these prairies
long before the need for a real god was discovered
little paper planes, drifting just under the radar
and the mushroom-shaped clouds
that rose from your throat in a prayer
for more witness and need for someone great and good
to cure the mad cattle of the penicillin scourge

god was here in the garden where the lettuce
and spinach grew invisible sponges that swelled up the belly
of vegetarians while he was having a laser cure
for being blind-sided by the best politicians
and the greedy guts of the honey’d hive
spilled themselves out in waspish hoards
to leave nothing but white pods
and buffalo skulls and white whale bones
that we euthanized rather than set free

look, here is god, pirouetting in the 
vaulted nightlights of street people
who mumble psalms and warnings
before the water rises again in the keys
and the wide--mouthed gulf

he searches, but in his pocket
is a page of phrases that came from dreams
of women and babies and young women
and fathers and sons and brothers
and mountains and streams, and the white buffalo calf",Spiritual

	She spins a web of orange in a thin line up the lake.

	Dusk catches the sun slowly diminishing over the water.

	The sky is crayon gray over the orange pop sun.

	Trees, bushes, and other foliage watch as the graceful sun makes her exit.

	They gently wave good-bye.

	She spins a web of orange in a thin line up the lake.

	A lone boat drifts in the midst of it all like the subject of a still painting.

	Ripples freckle the water.

	They play from the inside to the out.

Mr. Enos had passed away
almost ten years earlier
but she still spoke of him,
as though he was in the next room.

How they had struggled
working hard at the mill,
and dancing Saturday nights
at the union hall social.

And though it was many years 
since she had danced - 
since the crumpling effects of age
had twisted her body into a flesh and bone prison, 
she told me about the Victrola
he had brought home as a gift to her,
and how he used to take her  
dancing in the attic after young Ralph was asleep.

And in her eye, a glimmer, a tear? 


                   It stood tired, a WWII veteran on thin legs,
                   neglected for decades.
                   The tone arm was crosswise, thick needle
                   pointing accusingly at the rounded spindle.
  
                   Held aloft for too many unplayed songs,
                   the sweeping curves of the acoustic horn
                   sagged under the weight of dust
                   and time, and now peered downwards,
                   staring at the floorboards
                   like Mrs. Enos,
                   struggling to cross the room
                   with her aluminum walker.

                   Yet from inside the dark oak cabinet,
                   the Dorsey brothers looked up smiling,
                   while Glenn Miller's orchestra still
                   waited hopefully on the felt platter
                   for another turn of the crank.

                   And nearby, a small white dog 
                   sitting, 
                   head cocked to the side,
                   listening for his master's voice,

     Moon Songs
Moon flickers shone in her eyes like frozen shards of glass suspended high above her mountain home,
reflections of time journeyed lay in her mind like emeralds scattered about forest floors,
a form and flesh dwelling locked in time. 
		 
She could smell fresh crisp snow, 
the sound of cracking high above as she gazed ever forward, 
giant ice crystals began falling, plundering, fading to mountains below like drums and bells singing faster and faster; then silence. 
A stilled statue of a women watched winds circling; 
drifting up the mountain, resting peacefully, 
lapping a cool breeze at her robes.
		 
Beads hung at her neck; and hair floating about her face like water captured in slow motion,
quietly she began to sing of union and home. 
		 
A bird crowed at her side, perched on a frozen covered rock and began his song. 
Jade sparkled veins of the valley below leap into dancing spirals, emerald paved emanations formed the skies before the watchers. 
Moon above spoke of time cycles, 
they drifted upon carpets of mountain song. 
Neither knew of their songs yet they were as one,
home on high mountain song.

519,CarolDesjarlais,A Tear-tasted Truth - Gold,"There were no surgeries, no specialists,
no community of workers to help his mother,
or him.  No intervention for the little dark-haired
baby born with un-kissable lips.  Caverns
from bow of lips to the flattened nostrils,
that made his ears weep.  In his anger,
he pounded scars on his own eyebrows,
slit the two sides of his lips, broke
his own fist on the abnormalities.

Deaf, autistic, cerebral spasms,
Tourettes, kept him jangling to drums
none had heard.  But it was that mad music
that drew me to him.  How lonely a life
in an imposed cage of jingling bones
that not even he could hear.

I bought a rocker, made a deal 
with an absent awe-maker,
and bundled him in my arms
and taught him gentle touch,
my hand to his self-bruised cheek,
his gnawed knuckles to my wrinkled
face.  I put his palm to my throat
so he could feel my lullaby.

Soon, before he was surreptitiously dumped
on the mat on the floor of my Special room
full of Special kids, his head would bobble,
eyes wider than a dark heaven, as he searched
for my familiar face.  He could smile
if you knew how to define the cleft
that curled to one side.  He would attempt
to throw himself out of the arms 
of an anxious worker in order to get to me.

Soon, he learned to dip a plastic cup,
into cinnamon candies and dump them
into a container until there was one heart left
that he could tongue and allow to dribble
red love down onto his bib as I traced
the rows of Christ’s care-laden children
with him dangling his sweet jig on my hip.

Came time, as all times come, when grief
caused me to need the rocking more than he.",Spiritual
520,onewayoranother,the taste of wishes.,"we linger on the balcony tangled in metaphors 
somewhere between rosaries and 
nooses,
inhaling chemicals as the city
breathes beneath us.

you flick the butt over the railing,
sparks glowing as they hang
   suspended
in this moment between us.

I watch the arc of its fall, 
blinking a wish
into existence as the sparks wink
from the pavement and exhale the 
last remnants
 of stardust into the night.


you kiss the ash from my teeth.

As he turned to go, he whispered 
""I can never write you whole"" —
it was spoken through perforations of history,
those ragged splinters cleft between two hearts.
their stitchings ragged with effort and futility —
one last thought offered 
before the wretched sinking 
beneath the waves of a drifting hand, 
a quiet ""fare thee well"", 
a final letting go.
The old oak door closed heavily, 
a soft click of the lock, its punctuation —
silence sat in the corner,
its head bowed. Nothing moved —
not even shadows.
The sea had never seemed as subdued,
nor the rain as tender, as those first days and nights 
without his presence filling this small room.
His coffee cup sits on the counter,
waiting to be warmed  
(""please, just once more""),
to be held between his rugged, sinewy hands 
as he stared through the window 
at what lay beyond, 
somewhere out there 
where I could never go,
where he knew I would not follow.
Sometimes in the morning,
before consciousness fully arrives,
I reach across the empty bed for him,
forgetting he is gone —
and then memory and gravity return,
clutching my fingers.

Sometimes in the Morning by Merle Collins
Sometimes in the morning,
before mouth noise chase away knowing,
sea murmur sweetness against rock,
whispering loud to interpret dreams.
One morning like that,
sea roll into my dreams like is sea know the meaning.
And sea murmuring,
Think how man flow here without clothes, without nothing,
think how woman swim in with not one stitch to she name.
Woman that come with nothing, going out without one thing.
Sea nibbling murmurs against rock,
then mouth erupt and you can’t tell what was dream, what was wake.

As he turned to go, he whispered 

""I can never write you whole"" —

	 

it was spoken through perforations of history,

those ragged splinters cleft between two hearts.

their stitchings ragged with effort and futility —

	 

one last thought offered 

before the wretched sinking 

beneath the waves of a drifting hand, 

a quiet ""fare thee well"", 

	 

a final letting go.

	 

The old oak door closed heavily, 

a soft click of the lock, its punctuation —

	 

silence sat in the corner,

its head bowed. Nothing moved —

not even shadows.

	 

The sea had never seemed as subdued,

nor the rain as tender, as those first days and nights 

without his presence filling this small room.

	 

His coffee cup sits on the counter,

waiting to be warmed  

(""please, just once more""),

	 

to be held between his rugged, sinewy hands 

as he stared through the window 

at what lay beyond, 

	 

somewhere out there 

	 

where I could never go,

where he knew I would not follow.

	 

Sometimes in the morning,

before consciousness fully arrives,

I reach across the empty bed for him,

forgetting he is gone —

	 

and then memory and gravity return,

clutching my fingers.

Sometimes in the Morning by Merle Collins

Sometimes in the morning,

before mouth noise chase away knowing,

sea murmur sweetness against rock,

whispering loud to interpret dreams.

One morning like that,

sea roll into my dreams like is sea know the meaning.

And sea murmuring,

Think how man flow here without clothes, without nothing,

think how woman swim in with not one stitch to she name.

Woman that come with nothing, going out without one thing.

Sea nibbling murmurs against rock,

then mouth erupt and you can’t tell what was dream, what was wake.

Is shouting and slapping between rock and sea,

and it hard to remember the murmuring that happen

in the rock-whispering morning.

I knew even before I opened

that actually tickled my nose.
There was a sound that,
though silent,
called me, “Come”.
The surface under my hand
was incredibly soft while being,
at the same time,
infinitely substantial.  
That aroma – like blood -  but in a good way.
That sound, like a baby laughing at a nightingale song
on one hand while, at the same time,
being beyond description.
The feeling, a soft, strong, precarious, security 
mixed together in such a way that 
called a wild desire to 
eat it with a spoon lest any of it

My love weaves threnodies beneath my flesh, lifting
sensation as feathers thrust into darkening mapled skies;
his ink dips brightly into the hollows of my throat,
gathering new songs.
We are the sum of bad math gone astray,
gone into the woods of our own making
where creatures frolic and dance
within wavy subdivisions of marbled waters
that know no shame.
My love exhales the cooing of doves into my hair, twining
as branches rise up to meet the sun;
he twirls his fingers in the tides of my touch,
sounding like whales in the deep.
Dolphins click and weep into darkness of swirling seas
as oil makes its ugly surface rainbows, a travesty of lies 
told sweetly to children as they tremble under their covers, knowing 
nightmares are forming in the closets of imagination
and the grim brothers wait outside the glassy-eyed window,
their curtains drawn.
My love ascends, his words a horizontal purpose protruding 
through masses of clouds that would turn wind's soft breath into howls
of mediocrity and destruction; he sows his seeds understanding 
the imminent threat of droughts, of floods - still, he watches 
the soil for tenderness after blood recedes into dusky distances, 
his flute offering apologetic ballets of better days aloft;
there are glistening epiphanies beyond this hill,
awaiting archeologists' eager, small shovels.
 
""Nape Sauce"" - perfume. My husband says I smell like a meadow even without it.

between heart and breast

she reflects the purest intent,
shuffling bleached muslin underskirt
graying on the slide against slate
as she paces in the vestibule

perhaps her groom, a poet laureate,
panting in the wings
will know her and give her his name

her father shall give her up
to the arms of the sun and heat
and to warm night shadows
where, behind the closed door,
she shall be had

but rise, come morning, no less green
but smelling of roses, citrus,
and dancing in new shoes
a belly full of promise
ever young and burgeoning
she is dressed, again and again
in her wedding night arraignment
to dance new beginnings to life
ever new, ever lasting winter consummation.

Prayer flags near a temple,
in The Land of Snows,
made me feel reborn,
shorn of earthy clothes.

Blue sky and white water,
red fire - yellow earth,
mingled with the green air,
to grant me my rebirth.

A gypsy and a nomad,
and a pilgrim in Tibet.
I was all these things,
in a dream I can't forget.

By a yellow river,
I was a Buddhist monk,
who climbed the HIGHEST mountain,
with a Himalayan drunk.

Standing on Mount Everest,
my head was in a cloud,
that was white as snow,
before I knelt and bowed.

and

I rode on tiny horses,
with saddles red and gold,
to a Buddhist Temple,
that was very old -

where I felt my purpose,
was to be - and nothing more,
as a hundred red-robed Buddhists,
sat cross-legged on the floor.

O, in a Buddhist Temple,
I finally felt at home,
a ripple in a river,
made by a fish - or stone.
